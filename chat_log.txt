<Hexorg>: one more disconnect
<blackbird9999>: hey stopthetues
<StopTheTues>: o/ Rorick
<StopTheTues>: Hexorg: welcome back commander
<blackbird9999>: my internet keeps going out for 30 seconds at a time and it's infuriating.
<blackbird9999>: needed to vent that ha
<StopTheTues>: fuck ISPs
<blackbird9999>: I'm just worried it's a virus. I downloaded a budget software and my antivirus quarantined something when I opened it
<blackbird9999>: Then that's about the time the connection issue started
<blackbird9999>: malwarebytes picked up nothing running so idunno
<blackbird9999>: still paranoid this will be my life now
<StopTheTues>: you're good if malwarebytes didn't find anything
<blackbird9999>: Thank you for your reassuring words stopthetues
<blackbird9999>: I was thinking to myself...if I have a virus doing this...and antivirus can't find it. I wont be able to fix it unless I reinstall my OS FUCK!
<StopTheTues>: if you clean with malwarebytes and a registry cleaner you should be fine, unless you went to some crazy website which is unlikely
<blackbird9999>: I need to start opening up programs I download in Sandboxie
<UnstableFlux>: just reformat
<UnstableFlux>: easy peazy done
<blackbird9999>: Sure that by itself is easy, getting my computer back to whre it was before is a huge pain
<UnstableFlux>: It's 2019
<UnstableFlux>: Do you not just have cloud and/or hard back-ups of everything?
<UnstableFlux>: Or just a simple system restore point? :P
<blackbird9999>: I have my plain files backed up on a separate hard drive locally. But I'd have to reconfigure all my settings reinstal my programs etc right?
<UnstableFlux>: Depends on how you set back-ups
<UnstableFlux>: system restore is better for something like this
<UnstableFlux>: which is why you should set it to make on daily :P
<blackbird9999>: lol not very well. I have created a simple batch file and the xcopy command that I scheduled with task scheduler
<UnstableFlux>: But for me on my SSDs it takes about 45 minutes to reformat, download all my programs from my back-up, and make sure the settings are right
<blackbird9999>: I've never actually used system restore
<UnstableFlux>: So not too much time
<blackbird9999>: it saves the programs you have installed and everything?
<UnstableFlux>: I'm also paranoid and reformat 2-3 times a year so it's 2nd nature to me xD
<UnstableFlux>: Yup!
<UnstableFlux>: It's a system restore point
<UnstableFlux>: All you're doing is telling windows to delete everything that happened/downloaded/etc from after the restore point
<UnstableFlux>: If you choose to restore
<blackbird9999>: ok i'll start a new restore point schedule for daily
<UnstableFlux>: Not as good at getting rid of viruses and malware compared to a reformat but is still good

<Hexorg>: No like everyone in chat mentions that phrase

<Hexorg>: Exactly
<DadminFox>: Are you going crazy?
<DadminFox>: I've heard 'spinning my wheels

<DadminFox>: but not losing my wheels
<DadminFox>: It could also be losing my bearings
<DadminFox>: or
<DadminFox>: it could be hip kid speak
<Hexorg>: Shorty StopThe* and maybe Ginger at different times were like "dadmin said you lost your wheels"
<DadminFox>: Have i said that?
<DadminFox>: I dont recall ever saying that
<Hexorg>: Not when I was here haha
<DadminFox>: Was I drunk? even for drunk me that sounds weird

<Hexorg>: Switching from wifi to 4g kicked me off :-/
<naomi>: Genuine question bc i haven’t done this before. A number of people ive contacted about internships ask the same thing: are you looking for the internship to be paid or unpaid? I’m not sure what I’m supposed to say to that
<Hexorg>: "You better pay me, Im not a slave"
<naomi>: Like it seems straightforward enough but i feel like theres some kind of catch I’m not seeing
<Hexorg>: Yeah - companies want free work
<naomi>: I’m honestly fine with either, but of course id prefer to get paid for it??
<naomi>: Does it being paid change the work you do? The way they ask the quesion is confusing to me.
<Hexorg>: Generally - no
<Hexorg>: They just ask if you're willing to work for street creds
<naomi>: Id prefer $ but its not a dealbreaker

<blackbird9999>: I'll ask again maybe you guys will know. I was wondering if it matters (credit score wise) if I pay the balance on my card anytime before the due date or if the company prefers it on the due date.
<blackbird9999>: like pay it on the due date or just pay it whenever (as long as it's not past the due date)
<thebananaking>: no idea, I've never done the whole credit card thing
<blackbird9999>: I gotta build my credit up it's bad
<thebananaking>: with a family like mine... yeah, that's a hole I don't want to fall into
<blackbird9999>: I had to pay 200 dollars for a credit card lol
<blackbird9999>: a secured card they call it. It's a deposit because my credit was so low
<blackbird9999>: no other cards would accept me
<Wishes>: I've done both, as long as you pay on time (before the due date) your balance it's fine
<thebananaking>: ha, there was an awesome scam in the 2000s
<thebananaking>: pay-as-you-go credit cards
<blackbird9999>: pls explain
<thebananaking>: you pay the amount of the credit limit you want
<blackbird9999>: Thanks Wishes, i'm just want to ensure my credit builds up in the maximum way using the card
<thebananaking>: want a $5k credit limit? Just pay them $5k, and you can borrow up to $5k of your own money from them any time, at 23% per annum
<blackbird9999>: so i wasn't sure if on the due date was best or just whenever before it
<Wishes>: some banks also have a way to check your credit score on the fly free of charge without affecting it
<blackbird9999>: thebananaking why on earth would anyone do that
<blackbird9999>: oh cool, wishes
<Wishes>: in canada at least, and I have this option with my bank (and it's not an unknown one)
<Wishes>: perhaps check that out
<thebananaking>: because NO CREDIT CHECK REQUIRED APPLY NOW
<blackbird9999>: But why give 5k to borrow 5k why not just keep the 5k why would anyone ndo that
<thebananaking>: bad credit? Not a problem with our card
<thebananaking>: because they are STUPID
<blackbird9999>: i guess that's hat i'm doing in a way. I paid 200 for a 300 limit. But it's the only decent way for me to build credit
<blackbird9999>: It's a capital one card
<StopTheTues>: WISHES: uhh bonjour?

<shortyix>: but anyting you learn shoudl be taken with a grain of salt. in my experience, they don't car eif you pay off early

<muffinkins>: shortyix: the Ativan is for my anxiety dude
<shortyix>: i had to take it once after surgery, i don't remember a week of my life
<shortyix>: if it's just yhour prescribed dose, cool
<muffinkins>: Yeah it is
<shortyix>: but i'm here to tell you, i am the most miserable bitch alive after a brekaup, so I feel you.
<shortyix>: and 10000000x worse, is when you think everything is great and it comes out of nowehre
<shortyix>: it sucks
<muffinkins>: You probably took a higher dose if it was after surgery
<shortyix>: that's not the point here. tyhe point is, you're gonna have to let it out

<Hexorg>: I was just looking for that link, thanks TheCat5001!
<TheCat5001>: btw, how knowledgeable are you when it comes to entropy measures?
<Hexorg>: I found a leaked thumbnail from that picture
<Hexorg>: .
<TheCat5001>: ooh, interesting
<TheCat5001>: science gossip
<Hexorg>: About as much as needed to implement c4.5 algorithm
<TheCat5001>: i need an entropy measure based on correlations within a bit string, and i have an intuitive guess, but i can't seem to prove that it's correct
<TheCat5001>: it behaves as i think it should, but that's no guarantee that it's right
<Hexorg>: Have you seen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_ratio
<gonzobot>: Title: Information gain ratio - Wikipedia
<TheCat5001>: hmm, doesn't seem particularly useful in this case
<Hexorg>: uh... so www.google.com for me shows google doodle of birthday cake and says happy birthday hexorg
<Hexorg>: kinda creepy
<TheCat5001>: lol
<Hexorg>: TheCat5001, not sure what do you mean by entropy measure then... You can try passing the string through a compression algorithm and say the more it's compressed the less entropy there was
<TheCat5001>: the thing is, i don't have the string itself, only the correlations
<Hexorg>: ah
<Hexorg>: I guess it'd depend on how your correlations are expressed
<TheCat5001>: and from that i need to seem to work out how many strings correspond to those correlations
<Hexorg>: Uh... I think that's an NP problem
<TheCat5001>: well, it's something like "percentage of bits i places apart are equal"
<TheCat5001>: and then you get a value for each i
<Hexorg>: Yeah. you'd have to brute force the solution - does 000001 match? Does 000010 match? ... etc
<Hexorg>: it's essentially constraint solving
<Hexorg>: well
<Hexorg>: that's for arbitrary constraint definition
<Hexorg>: if that's the only correlation definition you have, you might just need to iterate for the length of the string
<TheCat5001>: but if your percentages are all 0 and 1, you get an entropy of 0 by definition, right?
<TheCat5001>: because it's all fixed
<TheCat5001>: and the string is infinite in length
<TheCat5001>: but might be periodic
<Hexorg>: Uh... I don't think sum of entropies of isolated systems equals entropy of a container system
<Hexorg>: but I'm not 100% sure this is getting out of my expertise
<TheCat5001>: it's such an unconventional way of defining a system it tends to break my brain a bit trying to visualize it
<TheCat5001>: because it falls squarely in between my knowledge of physics and my knowledge of information theory 
<Hexorg>: well physics is continious
<Hexorg>: quantum stuff aside
<Hexorg>: well fuck
<TheCat5001>: haha
<Hexorg>: wait when you say percentages are all 0 and 1... Are you saying 1% or 100% ?
<TheCat5001>: i can give you the full details if you want to break your brain on this
<TheCat5001>: 100%
<Hexorg>: Ok. So the bit string has many patterns in it. But entropy will still relate to the amount of patterns.
<Hexorg>: E.g. unless those patterns are related to each other, entropy is not zero
<TheCat5001>: yes indeed
<Hexorg>: s/related to/dependent on/
<gonzobot>: Correction, <Hexorg> E.g. unless those patterns are dependent on each other, entropy is not zero
<DadminFox>: o/
<Hexorg>: Can you just say entropy = amount of correlations?
<TheCat5001>: but the simple case of 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0, .... will have only one solution, right?
<TheCat5001>: well, two, the strings 10101010... and 01010101..., but i consider bit-flipped strings equivalent
<Hexorg>: is that 100% for i=0, 0% for i=1, 100% for i=2, etc..?
<TheCat5001>: yes
<Hexorg>: Yeah I guess so
<Hexorg>: are your correlations also infinite?
<TheCat5001>: for the periodic case yes, but not for the aperiodic case
<TheCat5001>: or rather, i'd assume those correlations to go to 1/2 after some distance, thus finite correlation length after which everything seems random
<TheCat5001>: which should have a very high entropy
<Hexorg>: I think you can still use that information gain formula just on the correlation strings
<TheCat5001>: want me to message you the full problem so you can break your brain as well? :p
<Hexorg>: uh... I'd rather not  sorry I have a long work day ahead
<TheCat5001>: haha, that's all right
<TheCat5001>: i'm just in this awkward position where i have an intuitive solution that seems to work beautifully, but i can't justify it beyond "it feel<Hexorg>: ugh my gitlab vm is eating too much space

<Hexorg>: Now I just have mortgage and wife's student loans left
<Hexorg>: feels good 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: im hoping by this time next year, wifey will be in a new car and the only debt ill have is that and a mortgage
<Hexorg>: Oh yeah, I'm still paying off two cars
<Hexorg>: dam,mit
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: if we keep grinding away at this, the truck should be paid off this year. and we should have a sizeable down payment saved soo the new car note wont be much more than we are paying now for the Mustang.
<Hexorg>: Yeah we'll pay one car off this summer
<Hexorg>: That's when I take a car loan to build a PC
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lmao

<Hexorg>: Yeah! It's exciting!
<Hexorg>: From what I gather, this confirms interstellar renderings 
<unstableflux>: I'm hoping by this time 2021 I'll be fully debt free
<Hexorg>: unstableflux, time to buy a house
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: other than a mortgage, ill be debt free by then
<unstableflux>: At the rate the economy is going
<unstableflux>: 2021 will be a nice housing bubble burst and good prices
<Hexorg>: ^
<unstableflux>: (by boston standards) 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i hope to be moving in to a new house by then too
<Hexorg>: I think I saw a graphic that said current housing prices reached pre 2008 depression
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: get out of this HOA and back into the country

<Hexorg>: man Do_it_in_a_Datsun I live in a city and I don't have HOA
<unstableflux>: but in reality I'll just be happy to be debt free and have maybe $10k in cash savings by this time 2021 lololol
<Hexorg>: unstableflux, that's the exact graphic I was referring to
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i never had an HOA until I moved to my current place. 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: savings? what is this savings you speak of?
<Hexorg>: Do_it_in_a_Datsun, it's what you call an account with $500 in it
<Hexorg>: and a 0.01% interest
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lolololol
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m waiting for a crash to buy a house as well
<TheRealMcFoy2>: HOA’s are bullshit
<Hexorg>: well Crash Bandicoot just came out
<Hexorg>: BTW
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: mine finally got a new president. dude is awesome
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I was looking at a nice lot to build on but there was a HOA that had to approve floorplans. I noped our of that
<Hexorg>: Crash Team Racing is coming out!!!!
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: the old lady that was running it sucks
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Hexorg, I think I have an unopened copy of the OG CTR
<Hexorg>: TheRealMcFoy2, ok I try to understand HOA reasoning. I don't agree with it but I generally understand where they are coming from... But floorplans? What are they afraid of? You'll build a secret lab or something?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: cookie cutter houses sell easier
<Hexorg>: Do they really?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: yup
<Hexorg>: huh
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: custom housing is harder to sell
<TheRealMcFoy2>: ‘Your floorplan has to match the rustic aesthetic they want in the neighborhood’
<Hexorg>: I would have never guessed
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: they just dont want an un-sellable house
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: looks bad if you have a house that gets abandoned because your MLP sex dungeon turned so many people off.
<Hexorg>: I guess I'm used to Boston where a falling-apart structure on a 0.25 acre plot will sell for $250k
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol
<Hexorg>: Like... when I was house hunting we saw a house that was missing half of the dry-wall and had a TON of water damage... They were asking $250
<Hexorg>: k
<Hexorg>: It was gone in a week for $300k
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: $300k will build my next house. thats insane
<unstableflux>: Hexorg: That was for the lot 
<Hexorg>: p much yeah
<unstableflux>: they 100% torn that house down or stripped to the foundation and rebuilt 
<unstableflux>: tore*
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: like, $300k is gonna get me 3 acres and a 2600sqft house.
<Hexorg>: but it also means they had the cash
<Hexorg>: and I couldn't possibly compete with that
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: thats just insane paying that much for a lot
<unstableflux>: Depending which part of boston that's actually cheap or average
<unstableflux>: Like by me in jamaica plain a bare lot would sell for $200,000-$300,000
<Hexorg>: Yeah I think it was in Summerville and within 0.5 miles from the T
<unstableflux>: Somerville

<unstableflux>: Just got access to swoosh.com for sneaker though so I'm pumped for that
<Hexorg>: I've heard there was another trail derailment today
<unstableflux>: I haven't bought a new pair of sneakers in about 10 years
<Hexorg>: I think we had 2 in 2 weeks
<unstableflux>: train
<unstableflux>: are you stroking out bro?
<Hexorg>: just a little bit
<unstableflux>: musictau: You want jerb?
<unstableflux>: we're hiring like mad atm
<unstableflux>: was it the greenline Hexorg?
<unstableflux>: There's an issue with the newer version of the cars where they derail easily 
<musictau>: unstableflux: uh, any backend positions?
<unstableflux>: Not the new greenline cars they're testing atm, but the new ones from 10 years ago or w/e
<Hexorg>: I think there was one purple and one green
<Hexorg>: musictau, doggie style
<musictau>: Oh wait... are you guys PHP?
<musictau>: Hexorg: ;)
<unstableflux>: Funny the cars from the 70s are more reliable and *won't* derail, and the cars from the 2000s are derailing monthly

<musictau>: So
<musictau>: Good
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: nice!
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: glad youre enjoying it!
<musictau>: FR was annoying at first but I’m getting the hang
<musictau>: And the tuning is far more stable in general
<musictau>: Because... it’s a way higher quality guitar
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: that first jump to a nice guitar is so satisfying 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i need to pick up an amp
<Hexorg>: Psh not enough Do_it_in_a_Datsun 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol
<Hexorg>: I'm planning on 64GB RAM at the least
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: dammmmmmn
<Hexorg>: In my defense, I actually have a use for it T_T
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i figured
<unstableflux>: Just build it yourself :P
<Hexorg>: I'm planning on it
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: flux, i was just posting it since EK built it
<Hexorg>: Just waiting for AMD
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: its a pretty badass build for the money
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i still want to build a new server for the house.
<unstableflux>: Aaaaaah
<unstableflux>: that makes more sense Do_it_in_a_Datsun
<unstableflux>: I want to build a server
<unstableflux>: I have no use for a server 
<unstableflux>: :(
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: plex
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: usenet
<unstableflux>: na
<unstableflux>: I pay my buddy $30/year for access to his plex
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: mmo minesweeper
<StopTheWed>: yo unstableflux why is the u lowercase today?
<unstableflux>: He's got a whole system setup where we can login to a site, request what we want him to add, and it auto-downloads from torrents 
<unstableflux>: dunno
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: sonarr?
<unstableflux>: logged in with the new kiwi UI, maybe that's why
<StopTheWed>: hmm
<unstableflux>: THK + Plex
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ah
<DadminFox>: your friend charges you for their plex?
<DadminFox>: ouch
<unstableflux>: yeah
<unstableflux>: He charges all of us lol
<DadminFox>: I mean, I can't blame him
<DadminFox>: but
<unstableflux>: He just spent $500-$600 upgrading it
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i think i just want to build a small one. 12tb in raid50
<DadminFox>: theres some serious legal issues that could come about that
<unstableflux>: It's worth it
<unstableflux>: I cancelled my netflix and hulu
<unstableflux>: so that alone goes from paying like $300/year for those to $30/year for plex
<unstableflux>: and I can still get all their shows 
<unstableflux>: down the road I'm going to make the same setup he has, but I don't have room for a homelab/server in my current place 
<unstableflux>: DadminFox true assuming anyone finds out what he's doing lol
<DadminFox>: thats what I was getting at
<unstableflux>: There's 6 of us including him that have access, all good friends 
<DadminFox>: distribution of stolen materials for profit 
<DadminFox>: I can see all sides of it really
<DadminFox>: hardware, leaving the server running, etc
<unstableflux>: He uses PIA + proxies and a firewall, so between that and the fact all of us are friends IRL and won't fuck him over the chance is a fraction of a percent 
<DadminFox>: Even without most of that, he would likely be fine
<DadminFox>: just a slap on the wrist 
<unstableflux>: And they'd have to prove we paid him, which he explicitly made us pay him cash
<unstableflux>: yup :P
<unstableflux>: which is why*
<GingerGirl_>: What's for lunch?
<Hexorg>: pain and suffering
<unstableflux>: Calling my insurance to see how much a chest xray is going to cost me
<unstableflux>: ^ what Hexorg said
<GingerGirl_>: Why do you need a chest xray
<unstableflux>: try to figure out what the fuck is going on and why I've had a cough + wheezing + congestion for 2.5 months
<unstableflux>: It's why I quit cigs again 
<StopTheWed>: you smoked tobacco unstableflux?
<unstableflux>: ..................................
<GingerGirl_>: where the f have you been
<StopTheWed>: lol I thought he just got high off weed?
<GingerGirl_>: I weighed myself last night. OMG I've put on weight
<Hexorg>: So you're 98 lbs now
<StopTheWed>: ^
<GingerGirl_>: 129
<GingerGirl_>: Dadmin and i convinced a friend of his that I was 200+lbs
<DadminFox>: true
<DadminFox>: lol
<unstableflux>: where the fuck do I even go to ask this question
<unstableflux>: Fuck our new HR shit is horrible to use and navigate 
<DadminFox>: Don't ask progressive or state farm
<DadminFox>: they are the wrong insurance groups
<Hexorg>: yeah I don't think I ever got a medical quote before the actual service
<Hexorg>: which sucks
<GingerGirl_>: call the number on the back of the ins card
<GingerGirl_>: and ask what the cover....Do you have a deductible?
<GingerGirl_>: they*
<Hexorg>: yeah they generally answer in percentages. I never gotten "this will cost you $###"
<GingerGirl_>: Right
<GingerGirl_>: bc they don't know what the hospital will charge
<unstableflux>: yeah
<GingerGirl_>: so it's prob like 80/20
<Hexorg>: and hospital won't tell you after they do the procedure
<Hexorg>: because that's not shady af
<GingerGirl_>: unless you have a deductible then you will pay it all
<StopTheWed>: wait unstableflux you have ppo? not hmo?

<Hexorg>: there is a slight chance my kid already exists as a sperm
<Hexorg>: so technically unstableflux is correct

<shortyix>: true, it's me
<shortyix>: i suck
<DadminFox>: you're a penis
<techis>: \o shortyix 
<void>: haha penis
<StopTheWed>: o/ void
<shortyix>: o/ techis
<shortyix>: lol penis
<StopTheWed>: so what is this Q shortyix?
<void>: hey StopTheWed o/
<shortyix>: so, we all know i'm working  2 jobs and studying. my boyfriend is doing a phd, he goes to work whenever he wants (so he tnds to sleep in til 10/11 and go to work 12-8). a week or two back i stopped giving a shit (i was staying up til midnigt to hang) and started getting up at 4:30am and enjoying my day the way i like to. 
<shortyix>: he didn't like that, and complained of not seeing me
<shortyix>: i bought bose sleep buds so he wouldnt' wake me when he wanted to get up at 3am to watch league, or the f1, and they help me sleep beter. he odesn't like those because he can't talk to me
<shortyix>: so i tried to comprimise schedule, but he always loses motivation and doesn't want to gym, or if i'm only getting up at 6:30 i don't want to talk to anyone until 8:30 or i get no alone time. he gets annoyed that when he wakes up ESPECIALLY to say good morning, when i've said i don't want to talk in the mornings and i don't want to appreciate
<shortyix>: am i being  a huge asshole in going fuck this noise?
<void>: no
<shortyix>: i wanna wear my sleepbuds, go to sleep and go to the gym at 5am. but apparently it's selfish
<shortyix>: and i don't have the best perception of relationships due to the past
<void>: it's good to do what makes you happy
<techis>: nta he could make a better effort. no reason to kill yourself if he wont make time for you
<void>: if a partner isn't going to help you do what makes you happy, they need to check themselves
<void>: also, early mornings are awesome and morning people are awesome
<shortyix>: well i figured i was being selfish, becuase i sai dhe could just owrk 10-6
<shortyix>: he can literally work whatever hours he wants to
<void>: yeah
<StopTheWed>: i agree, he seems to be taking it a little too sensitive for a slight schedule change
<void>: so he's the one who can change
<shortyix>: i love mornings, just because ther eare NO PEOPLE
<shortyix>: i need my no people time
<shortyix>: and like, if i takea  sick day he doesn't bother going to work. the flexibility is resentable :P
<void>: tell him to take a stroll around Manfeels park and get over it
<shortyix>: LOL
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Nta, especially if he won’t compromise
<shortyix>: he's a super dude, i'm just worried we'll be chalk and cheese for the remaining 2 years of his phd
<shortyix>: his goal this week was to make it to work for 10am once
<void>: if he wants to make it work he will tbh

<thebananaking>: well it's official, the lemon buns were a bit sad, and nobody like the white chocolate I used to try and unsadden them. Settled on lemon-coconut-pineapple instead. 
<shortyix>: that sounds wrong to me
<shortyix>: but i'll bet they taste great
<shortyix>: but i can't imagine the flavour
<thebananaking>: basically pina colada - coconut milk and a little lemon zest in the dough, bits of candied pineapple studded through. 
<StopTheWed>: lets get wASTED
<shortyix>: i tried makign keto custard last night
<shortyix>: turns out, i cannot stand erythritol

<shortyix>: awful
<thebananaking>: you know snoopjedi at all?? 
<shortyix>: no?
<thebananaking>: ah k, he's a reg on #loseit. Really turned me on to avoiding diet versions of things. 
<shortyix>: i'll check it out
<shortyix>: i typically eat eveerything in moderation, but have a special event coming up
<shortyix>: and i feel like a dumbass- I couldn't work out why i SOARED in weight/bloat last yr even though tumour has done a bit. even though i was counting calories, i seem to hate ccarbs
<shortyix>: prior to 12 mo ago, i ate br4ead maybe once every 2-3 weeks. now it was daily, even if it was counted
<void>: I tend to eat low carb, high protein
<void>: and I've tightened my meat suit a bit
<shortyix>: yeah i was the same void. now i am high fat, protein, low carb for awhile

<gonzobot>: Title: The Evidence for Caloric Restriction - Intensive Dietary Management (IDM)
<thebananaking>: why weren't there any fat people in auschwicz? 
<thebananaking>: or ethiopia during the famine, or...
<thebananaking>: cells eat glucose, it has to come from somewhere - if not from food you've eaten recently, then it has to come from fat stores
<thebananaking>: the problem is behavioural - getting people to stick to calorie-restricted diets is hard and largely ineffective work
<thebananaking>: because food is delicious and being hungry is unpleasant
<thebananaking>: gimmicky diets likely keep people onboard with the whole ritual aspect as much as anything
<shortyix>: i agree, and i think keto is a bit of a fad (like low fat diets wer ein the 80s), but with pcos i do struggle with insulin resistance and low carb naturally helps that
<shortyix>: it doesnt' have to be 'keto' to be low carb
<shortyix>: also, have you seen about Lucy the rat?
<void>: yep that's what it's good for, shortyix
<void>: and intermittant fasting too

<thebananaking>: that was such a brilliant scene
<surveyor>: Do_it_in_a_Datsun, you seem like someone who would keep a milk jug next to the couch and your desk to piss in
<DadminFox>: harsh
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: if caths werent so uncomfortable I would use them
<DadminFox>: I peed in a protein jug in Afghanistan, tossed it under the gunner platform and forgot about it for a month in 105F weather

<DadminFox>: it was a bunch of users laughing at the word penis
<DadminFox>: bunch meaining 3
<DadminFox>: meaining 
<DadminFox>: meaning 
<DadminFox>: fuck
<surveyor>: vagina is a funnier word than penis
<DadminFox>: disagree
<thebananaking>: well nothing's funnier thatn *your* penis, granted. 
<DadminFox>: not wrong
<surveyor>: schlong is funnier than penis
<thebananaking>: does it have a goomba tattoo?
<Wishes>: it's funny sized I assume?
<surveyor>: is DadminFox italian?
<DadminFox>: who knows
<thebananaking>: certainly not his mum

<Hypers0nic>: his trailer is hilarious
<thebananaking>: you can have surveyor, he's available
<surveyor>: who is having me?
<thebananaking>: Hypers0nic
<Hypers0nic>: presumably me 
<Hypers0nic>: Im not gay though
<DadminFox>: yet
<thebananaking>: beggars, choosers etc
<surveyor>: I think Id rather marry another straight guy than a gay one
<surveyor>: so I guess it's a done deal, Hypers0nic 
<Hypers0nic>: I don't think that is how that works?
<thebananaking>: I don't see why not
<thebananaking>: just because you're married doesn't mean you have to be shagging each other
<thebananaking>: just means you're family now
<surveyor>: are you jilting me, Hypers0nic ?
<GingerGirl>: .flirt shortyX 
<gonzobot>: shortyX, If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put U and I together.
<surveyor>: left at the altar, damn
<GingerGirl>: I need to fold clothes and pack but I just wanna sleep
<Wishes>: .flirt GingerGirl  
<gonzobot>: GingerGirl, Of all the beautiful curves on your body, your smile is my favorite.
<GingerGirl>: Awww hey bb
<thebananaking>: I mean I'm not sure why you'd want to marry someone you weren't into, romantically speaking
<Wishes>: ayy babe
<GingerGirl>: How are u wishes
<Wishes>: Going pretty well, working, buying furniture for new apartment, went for some wings with buds yesterday, that sort of thing
<surveyor>: tax break
<Wishes>: wbu?
<Hypers0nic>: its not always a tax break
<surveyor>: where do you buy furniture, Wishes ?
<surveyor>: Hypers0nic, yeah, true
<surveyor>: fine, we dont have to get married
<Wishes>: some at ikea, some at other local furniture stores
<Wishes>: some online
<Wishes>: bought my dining table online for instance
<surveyor>: furniture is fucking expensive
<Wishes>: unfortunately agreed
<Wishes>: :(
<Hypers0nic>: build your own
<Hypers0nic>: much cheaper
<surveyor>: can you make furniture?
<surveyor>: if so, the wedding is back on
<Hypers0nic>: I mean I can do a lot of things 
<Hypers0nic>: would I make furniture
<Hypers0nic>: probably not 
<Hypers0nic>: I would just buy it 
<surveyor>: youre an emotional rollercoaster man
<thebananaking>: ow my head
<thebananaking>: I think I'm coming down with something, but I'm not sick enough to go home
<thebananaking>: the paracetamol does NOTHING
<surveyor>: cocaine
<DadminFox>: smells good
<thebananaking>: I wonder if neurotransmitters smell weird
<naomi>: Do they have a smell thebananaking ?
<naomi>: Thats the first question
<thebananaking>: I have no idea
<thebananaking>: but doing lines of dopamine would be interesting
<naomi>: Norepinephrine shots
<surveyor>: ok, ripped from the /r/askmen headlines -- if you could trade inches from dick to height or vice versa, how many would you trade?
<thebananaking>: I'm good
<Five_Second_Pose>: I don't have much of either
<surveyor>: lame answers
<Five_Second_Pose>: So are my height and dick size
<DadminFox>: My height is fine, my dick is fine
<Five_Second_Pose>: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<shortyX>: .flirt GingerGirl 
<gonzobot>: GingerGirl, I'm so sorry, it seems I've lost my keys. Do you mind if I check your pants?
<surveyor>: you wouldnt prioritize one over the other, Five_Second_Pose ?
<DadminFox>: sounds like surveyor is lacking in some department
<Five_Second_Pose>: I don't have enough of either to begin with
<Hypers0nic>: that flirt was hilarious
<surveyor>: DadminFox, why do you say that?
<shortyX>: surveyor you'r weird dude
<DadminFox>: because mod = god
<surveyor>: I'm weird?
<Five_Second_Pose>: My penis size matters less I guess, I'm the only one that sees it
<Hypers0nic>: ah but the problem is, if you send it to your height, maybe other people will see it then
<thebananaking>: I hit my head on things as it is
<Five_Second_Pose>: Doubtful
<shortyX>: you literally come in here asking aout dicks daily
<shortyX>: either you're repressed
<shortyX>: or making up for something
<Five_Second_Pose>: Even if my entire penis was on my head I'd be under 6 feet tall
<surveyor>: hmm, ok, shortyX , thanks for the observations
<thebananaking>: 5'11" isn't short fsp
<shortyX>: lol dadmin that's what you voice me for
<Five_Second_Pose>: Easy come, easy go
<DadminFox>: close enough to /r/awardspeechedit
<DadminFox>: no voice
<DadminFox>: Ive accomplished nothing outside of drinking beer
<DadminFox>: shit
<Hypers0nic>: ingest some cocaine
<Hypers0nic>: then you'll be real productive
<Hypers0nic>: or dead
<Hypers0nic>: cocaine and alcohol don't mix well
<Hypers0nic>: wanna hear a funny story
<shortyX>: no
<Hypers0nic>: fine 
<Hypers0nic>: you would laugh though shorty
<shortyX>: i kid, i'd love to hear
<shortyX>: what is it
<Hypers0nic>: so two semesters ago or so
<Hypers0nic>: there were a bunch of frat kids on campus 
<thebananaking>: HAHAHAA
<shortyX>: a long long time ago
<Hypers0nic>: wait 
<shortyX>: i can sitll remmer
<Hypers0nic>: these frat kids were stupid
<shortyX>: however my key is roken
<Hypers0nic>: like really stupid
<shortyX>: seocnd letter of alphaet
<Hypers0nic>: in that they had a business selling cocaine 
<shortyX>: ok
<Hypers0nic>: and their method of choice in terms of delivery
<Hypers0nic>: was through the campus mail-service
<Hypers0nic>: so, one day 
<Hypers0nic>: the PO noticed that there was some odd white powder on their packages
<Hypers0nic>: and they checked it 
<Hypers0nic>: and lo and behold, it was cocaine
<Hypers0nic>: so sometime within the next week, the campus police deparment + DEA agents came through and raided a person's apartment 
<Hypers0nic>: on campus 
<Hypers0nic>: and they found like 5 kilos of the stuff
<Hypers0nic>: the end
<Hypers0nic>: yknow, I really thought this would've been funnier
<Hypers0nic>: it was hilarious to me at the time
<thebananaking>: coke will do that to you'
<thebananaking>: but yeah, undergrads are fucking stupid

<shortyX>: yes i roke my keyoard
<shortyX>: guess which key then
<shortyX>: that was me trying to fix it
<shortyX>: or communicate in hexorg languag4e
<shortyX>: one o hte other
<thebananaking>: you know it really sucks that for all our tech, we don't have anything that would would make an effective magic ring/amulet/etc
<thebananaking>: I mean sure phones and all, but they don't actually *do* very much wrt someone standing in front of you
<thebananaking>: even a magic staff; I suppose you could make a decent taser out of 4 feet of batteries, but...

<DadminFox>: Change your password now - no plaintext Matrix passwords were leaked, but weak passwords could still be cracked from the hashed passwords
<DadminFox>: they didn't pull a facebook!
<Hexorg>: So is snoonet hosted on top of matrix.org or...?
<DadminFox>: Change your NickServ password (if you're using IRC bridging) - there's no evidence bridge credentials were compromised, but if you have given the IRC bridges credentials to your NickServ account we would recommend changing this password
<DadminFox>: I actually find this funny, they say no plaintext creds
<DadminFox>: but if you look at your chat history
<DadminFox>: with Nickserv, there are your credentials

<Hexorg>: Just wanted to upgrade. My PC is from 2012
<DadminFox>: I picked up a Mac book pro recently. For the price of it, it could have built a sweet gaming rig and a few other things 
<DadminFox>: Ahh
<DadminFox>: What video card are you running? 
<Hexorg>: 970
<DadminFox>: Such a good card
<Hexorg>: Technically all but the video card is from 2012. Video card is from 2015
<DadminFox>: Even to this day
<DadminFox>: True 
<DadminFox>: I have a 970 in my server rig, but it's not doing anything because I haven't had time to set it up
<DadminFox>: That 970 has seen months of gaming 
<Hexorg>: yeah people bitched it has 500MB less memory than advertised... but I still run virtually anything at 1080P 60FPS
<DadminFox>: Yeah 
<DadminFox>: When I say months of gaming, I mean play time. It had years of use 
<Hexorg>: I'm interested in those new Ryzen CPUs though
<DadminFox>: I am becoming more OS agnostic and ACTUALLY kinda liking the Mac (don't tell nobody)
<DadminFox>: as far as chipset
<DadminFox>: I want to get some hands on time with AMD
<Hexorg>: I like Mac for as long as it's not mine
<DadminFox>: I understand windows at an Administrative level
<DadminFox>: I understand Linux at a basic admin level
<Hexorg>: swap the two for me
<DadminFox>: I want to understand Mac at a higher level than Linux, which is easy since its so similar to Linux
<DadminFox>: My problem with Apple really isn't the product itself (aside from the price), it's the users
<Hexorg>: it's the price for me
<DadminFox>: I don't understand their elitist attitude
<DadminFox>: I bought a refurbished one on PayPal credit since it was 0% for 6 months
<Hexorg>: *it's the price for me because most Mac users I met are also researchers who just want a really easy linux
<DadminFox>: I could have bought it all at once, but now I have some breathing room. I've paid half of it already and picked it up about 2 weeks ago
<DadminFox>: makes sense
<DadminFox>: also, I love the touch pad
<DadminFox>: I plugged in a mouse and the mouse felt clunky

<Hexorg>: I wanna use the black hole algorithm with wifi routers
<Hexorg>: You need a 26ft diameter lens to make a 64x64 pixels image out of wifi signals
<Hexorg>: You also technically need 4096 routers
<GingerGirl_>: I honestly have no idea what you're saying. You could be telling me the truth or a lie and I have no idea
<Hexorg>: No I'm being serious
<Hexorg>: the black hole algorithm solves both the need for a giant lens, and the need to have many many many sensors
<Hexorg>: But instead of using infra-red data, I want to use wifi data
<DadminFox>: lol
<Hexorg>: You'd be able to see through walls and see blurry people
<Hexorg>: likely - wires and metal pipes inside walls too
<Hexorg>: Just saying... would be cool
<DadminFox>: Id love to see that stuff
<Hexorg>: in one of our privacy efforts we found a group that doesn't provide video, but use machine learning on wifi signals bouncing all over the house and they were able to tell where humans are located, and what pose they are in

<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m reading metro 2033, so sometime next week I’m going to head to the metro stations where the book takes place, just to get a better idea of the setting
<Hexorg>: nice
<TheRealMcFoy2>: We did get to see St. Basils even though the square was closed
<Hexorg>: St. Basilisk I call it
<Hexorg>: Sorry I'm too pessimistic about Russia. I'm glad you're enjoying it
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It’s strange being in a country where I don’t speak the language though, my sister has to translate everything.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Also it was funny seeing the Russo Japanese war in the museum.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: “We totally would have won, but some stuff came up and we negotiated peace, by giving them Korea (which no one wanted)

<Guest72>: Hi
<naomi>: TheRealMcFoy2: you mentioned your sister is moving again sometime in the near future, what does she do that has her going all over the world?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Right now she’s teaching history, before she was teaching English, but she doesn’t know what she wants to do when she moves again
<naomi>: she must speak decent russian then right?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Oh yeah, she’s translating everything for me
<naomi>: i wouldnt mind getting into international work
<naomi>: maybe not full time, like idt id move and live abroad, but business trips i could do i think
<naomi>: if i really upped my french i could do trilingual interpreting
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Although the first day I was here some guy held the door for me. I instinctively said ‘thanks man,’ and he got this look like he was thinking really hard for a few seconds than said ‘you’re welcome!’ With a very proud look on their face. Made my day
<naomi>: thats sweet
<TheRealMcFoy2>: He probably hadn’t taken an English class in years, and I just surprised him with it in the middle of the city
<TheRealMcFoy2>: International would be a trip. I need to learn some languages
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Working internationally would be cool.
<naomi>: idk how i would do it, since i havent and wont have the opportunity to take college french in my undergrad. i did study abroad there, but very briefly
<naomi>: but i have the rest of my life to figure that out if i so choose
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m stuck being in the US for the next 13 odd years until I leave the military, so I’ve got some time to learn another language. I’d probably end up in Europe if I went anywhere
<naomi>: what language would you learn?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Depends on where I wanted to go. I took two years of Spanish, so I might start off with that
<naomi>: TheRealMcFoy2: i keep thinking of this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PvOSp4mxn0

<muffinkins>: You’d have to have it like a few millimeters away
<thebananaking>: but what if you had wet eyelashes?
<muffinkins>: That’s some extreme kinky stuff
<muffinkins>: When you’re worried about melting something on to your cornea
<muffinkins>: thebananaking: ask your dad!?
<thebananaking>: not as bad as a surgeon mate of his, putting in a hip replacement
<thebananaking>: basically they fillet you out like a chicken, saw off the top of the femur then hammer a stainless steel top-of-femur-on-a-stick down the middle of the bone
<thebananaking>: they'd got to that point, tapping the thing down, and it got stuck about halfway in
<thebananaking>: couldn't hammer it down any more, couldn't pull it out, and of course the bonesaw wouldn't even scratch it
<muffinkins>: Fun
<thebananaking>: and the patient had about 10 minutes left under anaesthesia
<thebananaking>: so it goes
<thebananaking>: at this point you discard the patient and obtain a new one
<muffinkins>: Lol 😂
<muffinkins>: thebananaking: what do you do?
<thebananaking>: IT support
<thebananaking>: won't catch me dealing with sick people all my life
<thebananaking>: just idiots :D
<muffinkins>: Haha
<thebananaking>: also I really wouldn't want an ADHD person one stuffup away from killing me
<muffinkins>: I’m adhd too
<muffinkins>: I want to join some new channels void
<muffinkins>: Any recommendations
<muffinkins>: .grabr thebananaking
<gonzobot>: (muffinkins) I couldn't find any grabs in #askmen.
<muffinkins>: Hmm
<thebananaking>: help, I'm being sexually harrassed
<muffinkins>: What happened
<thebananaking>: you trying to grab me :P
<muffinkins>: I was checking your grand
<muffinkins>: *grabs
<muffinkins>: .grabr void
<gonzobot>: <v​oid> the breeze from opening the bedroom door can get men off
<muffinkins>: Haha
<void>: muffinkins: um what kind of chats are you after?
<void>: actually, ask tomorrow, need to scoot out
<thebananaking>: if it's filthy or perverted, he gotchu fam
<muffinkins>: I know that about void
<muffinkins>: I was meaning less #sex and more like something smaller than casualconvo void
<Hexorg>: Happy Monday!

<naomi>: Morning Hexorg
<TheRealMcFoy2>: What’s up y’all?
<GingerGirl>: How's russia
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Fun, tiring. Saw a ballet yesterday that was amazing, did a walking tour of St Petersburg this morning. Chilling right now
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It’s super cheap too. Hostel is like, 9 bucks a night. Food isnt that much either
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’ve got a free night tonight. Contemplating booting up tinder and seeing if I can snag a date or not.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: How’s your week been GingerGirl?
<GingerGirl>: Sounds like it's been a good trip. My week has been going pretty good
<naomi>: Hey TheRealMcFoy2 !
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Hey Naomi! How are you doing?
<naomi>: Not too bad, sounds like russia is fun
<naomi>: Your trip
<Hexorg>: Sorry. Was driving
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It is pretty fun, got another day in St Petersburg before going back to Moscow. We’re taking a train back, so that’s pretty cool.
<Hexorg>: Glad you're enjoying it the
<naomi>: Hows the food TheRealMcFoy2 ?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Surprisingly good. They put sour cream on everything though. Georgian food is great
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Lots of dumplings and potatoes
<naomi>: Sour cream sounds like the opposite of a problem
<naomi>: My family is Polish on one side so I wonder if the food there is similar to it? Eastern european and all
<TheRealMcFoy2>: There’s a dish here that’s bread with a bowl cut in the middle, and you mix cheese butter and a raw egg in the middle. Then pull off bits of bread and dip it. Pheonominal.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Like cheesy bread but fancier
<naomi>: That sounds really good
<TheRealMcFoy2>: khachapuri
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Is what it’s called. The k is silent I think
<naomi>: I should have tried raw foods when i was in europe
<naomi>: Cause you can do that
<Hexorg>: Yeah the russian letter "Х" is like trying to roll hhhhhhhh. 
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I havnt had a whole lot of raw stuff, but I might try to get some. There is a kind of cheese here that’s like ricotta, but sweet. That cooked up is really good
<Hexorg>: That's farmer's cheese
<Hexorg>: I love it
<Hexorg>: I spent 10 years looking for it in the states
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It’s so good. Had it for breakfast this morning.
<naomi>: Ive heard of it
<Hexorg>: Yup' you just add lemon acid to milk and boil it till it curds
<Hexorg>: So it's not aged or anything
<naomi>: The russian food that confuses me is Xолодец
<Hexorg>: Hahaha
<naomi>: Like
<naomi>: Why
<Hexorg>: Yeah Im not a fan of it. Why - because it's cold outside and it's a cheap way to preserve food without the need to heat it up
<naomi>: Fair enough
<naomi>: Very creative lol
<Hexorg>: Yeah I mean I still remember my grandma leaving meat outside of the window for winter because we didnt have a fridge... And that was '93
<naomi>: I do that with ice cream lol
<TheRealMcFoy2>: My sister described a meat jello, she advised me against it lol
<TheRealMcFoy2>: May have to try it though
<naomi>: Yup thats it
<naomi>: Gotta remember to pick up ibuprofen today. Woke up with a few joints out
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Just blaze the joints and you might feel better
<naomi>: LOL
<naomi>: I must have just slept funny bc i didn’t do anythinng strenuous on sunday to cause it. Both shoulders and a few other joints were out this morning. Took me a solid hour to get up
<naomi>: A little better now but could use a painkiller
<TheRealMcFoy2>: When you say out do you mean dislocated?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Or out as in just hurting
<naomi>: Subluxed, which is partial dislocation
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Oof. That sounds awful
<naomi>: Some of my joints permanently are subluxed if not manually corrected, but theyre out to varying degrees. So theyre out more thanusual
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Is it like full dislocation, where the more it happens the easier it happens next time?
<naomi>: Not really
<naomi>: My connective tissue is weak
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I have a buddy who’s shoulder comes out every time he does pull-ups. He hasn’t reported it cause it doesn’t hurt and he’s about to go infantry and ranger school.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It used to only pop out occasionally, but now does it relatively often
<naomi>: Yeah thats unusual
<naomi>: The best way i can describe the feeling is imagine youve pulled every single muscle in/around your shoulder (including like neck area and upper arms)
<naomi>: Now do it again
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Doesn’t sound super fun
<naomi>: It isn’t
<naomi>: But its temporary
<GingerGirl>: Omg hey nocomobile 
<nocomobile>: Eyyo
<nocomobile>: Hows it
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Trying to wrangle up drinks with a Russian girl. How’re you doing?
<melagator>: kiwiirc website super different

<TheRealMcFoy2>: Tinder ain’t bad to try out though
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Might as well go for it
<melagator>: it's not terrible i guess
<naomi>: is it better or worse in a college town tho
<melagator>: as long as you have realistic expectations of what you're most likely to get 
<StopTheMon>: better
<melagator>: depends on what you're looking for 
<StopTheMon>: melagator giving out logical advice
<melagator>: i'm crazy but i'm not illogical ;)
<melagator>: i've been getting my shit together these last few months StopTheMon you would be so proud
<naomi>: meh, ive got a few weeks left living here till fall, we'll see
<StopTheMon>: awww yee
<StopTheMon>: melagator: a few wise girls told "All girls are crazy, just need to find which one you can handle/deal with"
<StopTheMon>: or something along those lines
<naomi>: gotta find what brand of crazy you like lol
<melagator>: i am indeed a special brand of crazy
<StopTheMon>: you are crazy but not heroin coked up whore crazy
<melagator>: StopTheMon i have a fun dating story from a couple months ago you will enjoy
<StopTheMon>: DO IT
<StopTheMon>: TELL ME
<melagator>: so i went on a date with a guy from my gym and it went well enough for us to talk about a second date
<melagator>: but he was going on vacation the following week so we discussed doing something when he got back
<melagator>: saw each other at the gym, texted daily, things are chill
<melagator>: he goes on vacation
<melagator>: comes back
<melagator>: does not talk to me or acknowledge my existence
<melagator>: i think i told y'all up to that point
<melagator>: but i had no idea why or what happened. just came back from vacay and it's like i'm invisible. 
<StopTheMon>: he sounds familiar
<StopTheMon>: who knows
<melagator>: fast forward to a powerlifting meet 2 weeks ago
<melagator>: he was there competing and i was not originally able to go but plans changed and i could attend so i went to support my girl who was competing (and other teammates, ex-date guy included)
<melagator>: his GIRLFRIEND was there
<melagator>: new girlfriend
<melagator>: who he met ON THE CRUISE DURING HIS VACATION and that is why he stopped talking ot me
<melagator>: so i was super nice and made friends with her :)
<melagator>: oh and his dad was there too
<melagator>: and his dad was hot
<melagator>: she lives in florida so they doing the long distance thing
<StopTheMon>: dad strange?
<StopTheMon>: you didn't tell me this story
<melagator>: lol nah he is married and has couple of teenage sons
<StopTheMon>: you can't seem to win here melagator
<StopTheMon>: married dad, teenage sons
<melagator>: i don't want that business
<StopTheMon>: but apparently kickball strange
<StopTheMon>: XD
<melagator>: kickball was a blast man
<melagator>: i miss him
<melagator>: he was my best friend. we only hooked up handful of times. mostly just hung out and talked all the time and it was nice
<melagator>: i miss the companionship
<StopTheMon>: you have bourban for that
<StopTheMon>: Don't DISS BURBY
<melagator>: bourby is the best
<StopTheMon>: .slap melagator

<naomi>: peace
<melagator>: bye
<GingerGirl>: I'm too old to chase random dick
<nocomobile>: Hinge is dope
<nocomobile>: But I will say in person works too
<GingerGirl>: I've never heard of hinge
<GingerGirl>: Hopefully I won't have to worry about looking
<DadminFox>: online dating is a shit show
<DadminFox>: lol
<melagator>: ^ thank you DadminFox
<DadminFox>: I haven't had much luck with it
<nocomobile>: All dating is a shitshow
<melagator>: i'm good enough at meeting terrible people in my day to day life. i don't need apps to introduce me to MORE terrible people
<DadminFox>: Haha
<nocomobile>: I thinknthe next time im single though
<nocomobile>: Im going to righteously fuck 18-21 year olds
<nocomobile>: And focus on other shit
<DadminFox>: Though I did match with a girl recently (it's my bathroom time killer). It seems like one message a day so far, but it's actual discussion, not "hey"
<DadminFox>: So that's something 
<DadminFox>: Also hello melagator and nocomobile 
<DadminFox>: Good to see you guys back 
<melagator>: hi DadminFox :)
<melagator>: been a while! how you been?
<DadminFox>: I've been pretty good, just extremely busy
<DadminFox>: Working full time, school part time (was full time last quarter), picked up a certification for my job (that was miserable, but its done now), learning to play hockey, and studying for my Ethical Hacker certification
<DadminFox>: How about you?
<melagator>: that sounds awesome! good kind of busy
<melagator>: i've been great. focusing on me lately :)  weightlifting is going really well, i have a meet the first weekend in May. working with a nutrition coach to get me to the weightclass i want to compete in for both olympic and powerlifting and progress is good so far. and been working on various mindfulness exercises to keep my crazy at bay ;)
<DadminFox>: Awesome! :D 
<melagator>: making little changes here and there, slowly but surely improving my life overall. it's definitely awesome
<melagator>: i feel awesome :D  
<DadminFox>: Not enough people focus on themselves, so that's great to hear 
<DadminFox>: Once I did that, my quality of life went through the roof
<DadminFox>: Now I just need to get back into exercising now that I'm not studying 24/7
<melagator>: yeah man i've not really done that and to finally be doing it is the best thing i could do for myself
<melagator>: it's only been a month of a real, focused effort but the changes are already obvious and it's a lot more motivating/easier to keep it up than it was to get started 
<DadminFox>: Haha, no kidding 
<nocomobile>: Im studying now
<nocomobile>: Also having a broken leg does wonders
<DadminFox>: what are you studying?
<melagator>: how did you break your leg?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m trying to focus on myself when I get back from vacation, thinking about doing a month of no drinking and see where it takes me
<melagator>: heck yeah TheRealMcFoy2
<naomi>: This’ll be my 4th week of regular swimming and its making changes already
<DadminFox>: nice
<melagator>: .hi5 naomi
<gonzobot>: melagator halfheartedly high-fives naomi
<heili>: monday n shit ....
<melagator>: oh man that's a lot less enthusastic than i hoped
<DadminFox>: No drinking can be a pain, but if you can occupy your time properly, it isn't so bad
<naomi>: Lol melagator
<melagator>: swimming is GREAT naomi
<DadminFox>: I have faith in you TheRealMcFoy2 
<naomi>: heili: whatever happened w that coworker guy of yours
<naomi>: The one who couldn’t code
<melagator>: after dating an alcoholic for 6 months no drinking is a lot easier
<heili>: oh he still can't code.
<heili>: but "we're a team so we help each other"
<heili>: FML
<naomi>: Ew
<melagator>: but would not recommend as a means to get you to stop drinking
<naomi>: melagator: true biz
<DadminFox>: I enjoy my beers here and there, but there are definite times when it becomes a problem
<DadminFox>: knowing when its a problem is the biggest part
<melagator>: all jokes aside i hope he sorts that shit out. but it opened my eyes to a reality i had never seen or experience personally. made me want nothing to do with drugs/alcohol 
<naomi>: I know i have to be careful when i turn 21 this yr
<DadminFox>: kinda sucks
<melagator>: DadminFox it's tough man.
<DadminFox>: I get by
<melagator>: what more can ya do? :)
<DadminFox>: I'm still happy :P
<DadminFox>: I need to shower and find some clothes to go skate
<melagator>: skateboard?
<melagator>: rollerskate?
<melagator>: ice skate?
<DadminFox>: ice skate
<DadminFox>: got to make sure the new ones work well for me before the rest of the hockey stuff moves forward :P

<melagator>: wearing a pad usually helps with that.
<naomi>: LOL
<StopTheMon>: did he have a siezure?
<StopTheMon>: o/ Hexorg
<Hypers0nic>: I think the bar compressed his spine

<StopTheMon>: nice TheRealMcFoy2
<Hexorg>: StopTheMon: E?

<TheCat5001>: On another note, apparently, I'm getting really good at theorizing about bdsm and giving people insight by talking with them
<TheCat5001>: I guess I'm building a certain expertise there
<TheCat5001>: Which is probably not the kind of expertise that's often valued
<GingerGirl_>: Does anyone remember that piece of shit girl who talked her bf into killing himself?
<Hypers0nic>: was she australian or something?
<Hypers0nic>: I think  I remember reading about it a while ago 
<Hypers0nic>: why 
<GingerGirl_>: I was wondering what she was charged with
<TheCat5001>: Electrons, probably
<GingerGirl_>: ...
<Hypers0nic>: that doesn't even make sense 
<Hypers0nic>: involuntary manslaughter looks like 
<GingerGirl_>: That's what happens when TheCat5001 tries to make a joke
<TheCat5001>: You make it sound as if I didn't succeed
<StopTheMon>: I do remember the time of the mod brigade
<GingerGirl_>: rip chat

<naomi>: like can you play a game together using discord?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: nothing to be shy about. you probably dont sound as goofy as I do
<naomi>: or do you play independently but together
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: you can chat and do your own thing
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: or play a game together
<naomi>: it'd be fun to play pretend youre xyzzy w irc

<naomi>: the original decks pyx has made arent super funny but there are people who have made cardcast decks of the original CAH packs.expansions

<thebananaking>: eep, no
<thebananaking>: mind you I go back a long way
<thebananaking>: I'm dead jealous of kids these days; their TV shows are orders of magnitude better than when I was a kid
<thebananaking>: well, apart from sesame street. That was always awesome. 
<thebananaking>: but they are *so* much more sophisticated
<thebananaking>: and I'm actually curious as to how edu-psych doctrine has changed since I were a lad
<shortyix>: sesame st is fucking dope
<shortyix>: those 19 were definitely of my childhood
<thebananaking>: <insert cave-painting jokes here>
<shortyix>: i think kids shows these days, the kids look way more adult?
<shortyix>: like kdis shows in my days they looked like... kids
<thebananaking>: even the pre-school shows; kids these days have Backyardigans with sophisiticated music and adventures and jokes; I got Play School making alligators out of egg cartons and playing with a rag doll. 
<shortyix>: hahahaha

<StopTheTues>: you're still 20's....
<melagator>: but i've never liked the idea of being pregnant or giving birth
<melagator>: i'm basically 30
<melagator>: which is basically dead
<StopTheTues>: how so?
<melagator>: kidding
<StopTheTues>: lol
<Hexorg>: I know a lady who just got pregnant at 47...
<StopTheTues>: ^
<naomi>: Even if i did want children, i cant imagine being in a place in my life to have them before 30
<melagator>: it's totally posible
<melagator>: but not necessarily a good idea
<Hexorg>: ^
<melagator>: higher risk of birth defects
<melagator>: we knew a family in the UK that had 10 kids. they had a baby every other year. baby number 11, the mom was in her 40s and baby had dwarfism 
<melagator>: catholic family
<Hexorg>: maybe she cheated with a hobbit?
<melagator>: it's totally possible
<GingerGirl_>: I wish I could have one more
<melagator>: but not necessarily a good idea
<melagator>: that being said
<Hexorg>: that
<melagator>: my cousin had a baby born with dwarfism as well
<melagator>: and he and his wife are in their 20s 
<melagator>: so
<StopTheTues>: oof
<StopTheTues>: the genetic lottery is never fair
<melagator>: yeah man, and her particular genetic mutation is extremely rare
<naomi>: I wouldn’t want to pass on my shit to a kid for sure
<Hexorg>: plz don't poop on your kids
<Hexorg>: s/your //
<gonzobot>: Correction, <Hexorg> plz don't poop on kids
<Hexorg>: are the stones - your poop?
<StopTheTues>: LOL
<naomi>: Lmao
<naomi>: I meant the bs ive got is genetic

<melagator>: pretty interesting actually watching her grow up
<Hexorg>: naomi's gonna have one stretchy boi

<unstableflux>: And will be playing for 8 hours straight tonight xD 
<GingerGirl_>: Because you're 12?
<unstableflux>: I'm 12.5 thank you
<SlimSkittle>: i got unbanned from snoonet 
<SlimSkittle>: so i guess good
<GingerGirl_>: Why did you get banned
<SlimSkittle>: uh
<SlimSkittle>: not sure if i want to go into it but it was dumb
<GingerGirl_>: story time
<SlimSkittle>: someone got really mad at me in  another channel
<SlimSkittle>: was weird cause they arent even a regular there
<SlimSkittle>: i was kinda bein a dick to be fair
<SlimSkittle>: they blocked me but then i changed my name to apologize, which got me banned
<SlimSkittle>: apparently that is "repeated targeted harassment of multiple users"
<StopTheTues>: from snoonet completely? not just the channel?
<StopTheTues>: on
<StopTheTues>: oh*
<SlimSkittle>: yea from the whole server
<SlimSkittle>: tbh if someone was gonna be banned from the channel it would have been them and not me 
<SlimSkittle>: there are no freakin rules over there
<DadminFox>: gg
<naomi>: my tuesday's been stressful as well
<SlimSkittle>: why
<SlimSkittle>: taxes were due yesterday
<SlimSkittle>: today is low stress
<naomi>: I sent my taxes in in march lol.
<SlimSkittle>: weirdo
<naomi>: i had to do them in two states so i wanted to just get it over with
<Hexorg>: I did mine in february
<SlimSkittle>: my sister was so mad that she owed taxes and didnt have any money put aside for it
<unstableflux>: I got my tax refund the 2nd week of february..
<unstableflux>: Y'all are slackers
<naomi>: School, health stuff recently, and got some bad news this morning is all
<unstableflux>: ;)
<SlimSkittle>: why even file early
<SlimSkittle>: like whats the point
<naomi>: to get it off your plate
<unstableflux>: Get it done and out of the way, get my money back sooner
<SlimSkittle>: who cares
<naomi>: me
<SlimSkittle>: oh i never get money back 
<SlimSkittle>: cause i dont withhold
<unstableflux>: And this year in particular get in 'line' early in case the IRS was actually fucked from the shutdown
<naomi>: the same way id rather get my assignments done sooner than later
<unstableflux>: I don't withhold either
<naomi>: im owed like $60
<unstableflux>: But I still pay student loan interest 
<SlimSkittle>: then how are you getting money back 
<SlimSkittle>: oh ok
<unstableflux>: And this year I guess slightly overpaid my paycheck taxes by like $200
<unstableflux>: this years taxes on 2018 checks*
<SlimSkittle>: mine came out lower than i was anticipating so that was nice
<SlimSkittle>: was still worse than last year though 
<SlimSkittle>: thanks republicans ya fucks
<unstableflux>: same
<unstableflux>: my 2018 return netted me $2k
<unstableflux>: I got 1.5k this year
<SlimSkittle>: i got completely fucked over because of salt
<DadminFox>: I want to inflate a balloon with farts and then have it float away. I really hope someone mistakes it for helium and sucks it down
<GingerGirl>: Couldn't you spray some fart spray in one and then have it filled with helium
<SlimSkittle>: according to chemistry and physics your fart balloon would sink
<SlimSkittle>: sorry bro
<GingerGirl>: Or are your farts powerfully enough to inflate a balloon
<DadminFox>: what if I do a 50/50 mix of fart to helium??
<Hexorg>: .g density of helium
<gonzobot>: (Hexorg) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium -- Helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography. The age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium dating. Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics applications.
<Hexorg>: .g density of air
<gonzobot>: (Hexorg) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air -- The density of air or atmospheric density, denoted ρ (Greek: rho), is the mass per unit volume of Earth's atmosphere. Air density, like air pressure, decreases with increasing altitude. It also changes with variation in atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity.
<Hexorg>: .g density of sulfur
<gonzobot>: (Hexorg) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur -- The density of sulfur is about 2 g/cm 3, depending on the allotrope; all of the stable allotropes are excellent electrical insulators. Chemical properties. Sulfur burns with a blue flame with formation of sulfur dioxide, which has a suffocating and irritating odor.
<DadminFox>: will my farts work?
<Hexorg>: So helium - 0.0001786 g/cm3, fart - 2 g/cm3, air - 0.001225 g/cm3
<SlimSkittle>: so no, theres almost no chance it will work 
<DadminFox>: okay
<SlimSkittle>: but you could use your fart for rocket propulsion
<DadminFox>: well I want to do it anyway and it will just hang out
<DadminFox>: then if the fart hits a candle, it will do its thing
<DadminFox>: I haven't lit a fart in a few years. I should probably brush up on that talent
<Hexorg>: You actually can do 10 parts fart to 1 part helium
<Hexorg>: and it'll still float
<StopTheTues>: isn't most of fart gas methan/sulfurous mix?
<DadminFox>: YOU'LL FLOAT TOO
<Hexorg>: my math can be off I'm super tired
<DadminFox>: 10 farts to 1 part helium
<DadminFox>: my life is one big gay fart joke
<DadminFox>: I'm cool with it
<Hexorg>: 1 part helium. Not rainbow
<Hexorg>: where did gay come from?
<DadminFox>: its basically the story of my life, thats all
<GingerGirl_>: I wonder if the vending machines have M&Ms
<DadminFox>: today is moving slow
<StopTheTues>: Tuesday slumps

<Hexorg>: morning
<Hexorg>: DadminFox, https://i.redd.it/l1z5byt72ps21.jpg
<naomi>: So i added someone on snap last night with the same name as another friend and neither of them have bitmojis
<naomi>: I’m gonna have to add their state abbreviations after their names lol
<Hexorg>: what's a bitmoji?
<Hexorg>: is that a snapchat thing?
<Hexorg>: I still remember when snap chat was for dick pics
<Hexorg>: and boob pics
<DadminFox>: Lol
<naomi>: Hexorg: its a little cartoon version of the user, customizable and made by them
<DadminFox>: Yesterday I found a site that called a database full of user/pass breaches 
<naomi>: They tend to be pretty accurate
<Hexorg>: cel shaded dick pics
<Hexorg>: what a time to be alive
<DadminFox>: When you type a username it gives you in plaintext the password
<DadminFox>: I laughed so hard at some of my old passwords, most looked like I was either a kid or drunk 
<Hexorg>: DadminFox, when you do client-side authentication 
<DadminFox>: ?
<Hexorg>: -Hey client, do you know that your password is 123456? -Yes. -Come on in!
<DadminFox>: Nah, not that
<DadminFox>: It was a dark net site that I was linked yesterday, so I spent about 30 mins on it sifting 
<Hexorg>: a dark net site that stores plaintext passwords?
<Hexorg>: Shouldn't they be more secure or something?
<DadminFox>: No no no, it was a dump of like 40 breaches 
<Hexorg>: ah!
<DadminFox>: So you typed in a username and if they had a password, it would display every user/pass on file
<Hexorg>: I thought you meant their login was very unsecure
<DadminFox>: It's about 8 passwords behind for me
<DadminFox>: Oh, no. Hahaha
<DadminFox>: I know these dumps exist, but I've never been able to find my info until last night 
<naomi>: DadminFox: whats the best thing we can do for password safety?
<DadminFox>: A friend of mine didn't believe me, so he gave me 3 accounts to check. He spent 20 mins changing his passwords last night 
<DadminFox>: naomi: honestly, always assume you're compromised. Change passwords often (yearly?) and use MFA/2FA
<naomi>: My school system requires a password change every 6 months. Maybe i should get on that for my other accounts too

<Hexorg>: Just don't use "correct horse battery staple"
<naomi>: Yeah lol
<DadminFox>: Lol
<DadminFox>: The multi factor authentication is your best bet imo
<DadminFox>: It can be defeated, but takes a lot more work
<Hexorg>: well the only problem with that is that not everything uses it
<DadminFox>: Agreed
<DadminFox>: If it's available, use it 
<Hexorg>: ^
<naomi>: Like how google does?
<Hexorg>: exactly
<Hexorg>: Google actually opened it's authenticator to everyone
<Hexorg>: but not everyone still uses ut
<Hexorg>: *it
<DadminFox>: I have about 20 instances of MFA setup that I'm aware of 
<DadminFox>: It's a hassle, but worth it
<Hexorg>: mainly because very few people think about security

<gonzobot>: Correction, <DadminFox> its a hassle, but worth it
<Hexorg>: dammit
<DadminFox>: ?
<DadminFox>: Lol

<naomi>: Also how do you change your password on here bc i saw the notice but haven’t done it yet
<Hexorg>: that... I still don't kn
<Hexorg>: know
<DadminFox>: nobody cares about security until its too late
<Hexorg>: You can reset your password... but that's if you forgot it...
<DadminFox>: As far as pw here, I haven't had time to find that out. I'll make that part of my weekend 
<DadminFox>: I'm late for work
<DadminFox>: Blah

<naomi>: Hexorg: i have a question abt russian
<naomi>: I had a russian math professor a few semesters ago who would say “how” when a native english speaker would say “what.” Like she would say “how do we call this property?” (Of math) instead of “what do we call this property” so I’m curious if theres an underlying language thing happening there. Like how a french speaker may say “how do you call yourself?” instead of “what is your name?”

<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: keep it simple and make a pair of stools/foot rests
<Hexorg>: naomi, yes. In russian you'd ask literally "how to call this" instead of "what to call this". Just because you're asking "How [would I] call this?"

<Hypers0nic>: is Rorick a neural net

<StopTheWed>: uhh i forgot he's a bot that uses what is it called hexorg

<Hexorg>: Hypers0nic, it's a bot
<Hexorg>: currently it uses nothing
<Hexorg>: it just stores all we say here
<StopTheWed>: crap
<Hexorg>: I want to write a markov chain

<Hexorg>: you mean for work?
<Hypers0nic>: yeah 
<Hexorg>: Computer security
<Hypers0nic>: have you done ML stuff
<Hexorg>: yeah
<Hypers0nic>: if it stores everything, would it be hard to implement a RNN that is trained on everything we say here 
<Hexorg>: it wouldn't be hard to implement one, but you'd need to come up with a good evaluation function 
<StopTheWed>: .8ball will Rorick be cool?
<StopTheWed>: aww yeeee
<Hexorg>: lol
<StopTheWed>: even the other bot agrees
<naomi>: Oh hey StopTheWed
<naomi>: Didn’t say hi to ya yet
<StopTheWed>: o/
<StopTheWed>: .8ball will Rorick predict naomi getting SUM?
<StopTheWed>: even better
<naomi>: Ooo
<Hexorg>: Hypers0nic, if you come up with evaluation function that reinforces RNN to output phrases that we say... well then it's just a parrot that repeats 1 to 1.
<Hexorg>: We don't exactly have a good definition for what a coherent speech is
<Hexorg>: so no one really has a good evaluation function
<StopTheWed>: RNN output?
<Hexorg>: RNN output would be speech. Evaluation function is how you train RNN
<StopTheWed>: ahh
<Hexorg>: RNN - recurrent neural network
<Hexorg>: unless we find out that brains do some quantum stuff. RNNs are closest to brains we have.

<Hypers0nic>: wait hexorg, what do you mean by economics is like weather forecasting
<Hexorg>: We don't have perfect models.
<Hexorg>: So we don't know shit
<Hypers0nic>: no one has perfect models for anything
<Hexorg>: We can only guess
<Hexorg>: I have a perfect model for gravity

<DadminFox>: dude is trying to convince people that he got hacked for going on the dark web and someone created some subreddit
<DadminFox>: dumbshit 
<Hypers0nic>: except that doesn't bind for specific circumstances hex
<Hypers0nic>: its one of the reasons we have special relativity!
<Hypers0nic>: newtonian mechanics work well enough for most situations
<Hypers0nic>: but they don't perfectly describe everything
<Hypers0nic>: and yet they still got us to the moon
<Hypers0nic>: more or less
<Hypers0nic>: all models are wrong, some are useful
<Hexorg>: Sure. But in economics and weather we don't even have models that " work well enough for most situations"
<Hypers0nic>: but the paradigm we follow is different 
<Hypers0nic>: the key part is recognizing when our models work
<Hypers0nic>: and when they don't

<Hypers0nic>: its like in differential equations
<Hexorg>: well that's the thing we don't know exactly when weather models and economy modles don't work
<Hypers0nic>: but we can have a pretty good idea!
<Hexorg>: no
<Trezker>: Well, for economics, whatever model becomes established will be made inaccurate by people trying to use it.
<Hypers0nic>: that is the whole point of reduced form empirical work
<Hexorg>: we just know that they don't work N percent of the time
<Hexorg>: with gravity, we know exactly the conditions our model falls apart
<Hexorg>: in weather we don't
<Hypers0nic>: its not the model falling apart 
<Hypers0nic>: its applying the wrong model
<Hypers0nic>: take the debate about the minimum wage 
<Hypers0nic>: you think about supply and demand, you get, well price floor, hat does that do
<Hypers0nic>: should decrease employment right 
<Hypers0nic>: but it doesn't 
<Hypers0nic>: why doesn't it 
<Hypers0nic>: because that is the wrong model for the labor market!

<DadminFox>: we all would  die
<UnstableFlux>: winters here would kill them :P
<Hexorg>: well if there are no perfect models then all models are wrong
<Hypers0nic>: exactly!
<Hypers0nic>: all models are wrong, some are useful
<DadminFox>: everyone that thinks they will survive a Zombie Apocolypse are usually the first to go
<DadminFox>: would likely be the first to go*
<DadminFox>: lol
<Hypers0nic>: think about it like this
<UnstableFlux>: Oh I don't think I'd survive 
<Hypers0nic>: if we had to make a perfect model 
<DadminFox>: I'd die
<Hypers0nic>: we would have to perfectly map everything 
<Hypers0nic>: and well the only thing that can do that is the thing itself
<Hexorg>: ohkay so what's your argument aside from my use of english words is different than your use of english words?
<DadminFox>: I have a lot of skills to last a long time, but I guarantee I'd die
<UnstableFlux>: I'd probably just ride it out on my roof with a bottle of whiskey and one in the chamber 
<Hypers0nic>: my argument is that all models are wrong does not imply we don't know anything 
<DadminFox>: if I didn't die due to zombies killing me, I'd probably die of suicide from being isolated from humans

<Hypers0nic>: I don't know what that means
<Hexorg>: you know the figure of speach "don't know shit" is often approximately used as "know very little"
<DadminFox>: Nobody told me nothin
<Hypers0nic>: ok, then here is my argument: all models are wrong does not imply we know very little 
<Hypers0nic>: it implies we don't know everything

<Hypers0nic>: if you want to see something that I think is a pretty cogent take on the topic 
<StopTheWed>: UnstableFlux: i can still outrun the fatties!
<StopTheWed>: XD
<Hypers0nic>: question: do fat zombies run slower than smaller zombies
<Hexorg>: well that's just subjective. Very little is larger than zero. don't know everything is less than infinity. So unless you want to figure out an exact metric for knowledge we're just wasting time.
<UnstableFlux>: Hypers0nic you're missing an input field 
<UnstableFlux>: How long are the fat v. skinny zombie legs
<UnstableFlux>: fat + long legs still means faster due to stride length 
<DadminFox>: how long have they been rotting and in which environment?
<UnstableFlux>: compared to skinny and short
<DadminFox>: I remember having that book in Afghanistan, lol
<Hexorg>: You got many zombies there DadminFox?
<UnstableFlux>: That's what I referencing with my winter comment earlier ;)  
<DadminFox>: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/IF1Noq7S/image.png
<DadminFox>: Terrorists that looked like zombies
<Hexorg>: Hypers0nic, I think at the end we are just arguing about glass half-full vs glass half-empty
<StopTheWed>: .8ball is the glass half full?
<StopTheWed>: .8ball is the glass half empty?
<Hexorg>: .8ball is glass half full with StopTheWed's blood
<Hypers0nic>: I think it’s a bit more than that since I suspect I think that we know a lot more about the economy than you think we do

<DadminFox>: funny that you mention LSD
<DadminFox>: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/O3ODRbM5/image.png
<DadminFox>: I wasn't shit faced, but I was definitely feeling good
<DadminFox>: I did some deepweb exploring last night. Against my personal rules, but it was fun
<DadminFox>: found mostly carding forums and drugs, as expected
<Hypers0nic>: carding?
<Hypers0nic>: also morning y'all
<DadminFox>: stealing credit card information and the works
<Hypers0nic>: oh
<DadminFox>: that and toyed with some password dumps and a few other misc items
<DadminFox>: lotta 404s
<DadminFox>: my roommate shocked himself last night
<DadminFox>: he broke a lightbulb on accident trying to remove it from the underside of the microwave
<DadminFox>: instead of unplugging it, he grabbed some tools to pull it out and then he touched the metal 
<DadminFox>: ... drunk me warned him. Sober him ignored
<DadminFox>: dumbshit
<GingerGirl>: But it was prob pretty funny
<GingerGirl>: It's pouring down rain and I don't wanna get out of my car
<naomi>: Ill trade ya GingerGirl i love rain
<DadminFox>: I kinda want to shave my beard
<DadminFox>: all the way off
<DadminFox>: then start from the beginning
<DadminFox>: I got lazy recently, so it has a lot of grossness
<GingerGirl_>: Then you will look like a kid
<DadminFox>: probably
<DadminFox>:   have a couple of ideas
<DadminFox>: Let it go from where its at
<DadminFox>: Shave, then grow wild while maintaining
<DadminFox>: or just letting it do its own thing after shaving
<DadminFox>: or I could keep it neat

<DadminFox>: What's the point of that sub? 
<DadminFox>: Why do people think it's okay to smear shit on a toilet seat? Especially in a corporate environment 
<StopTheThur>: I think it's just to promote water?
<StopTheThur>: and water memes
<StopTheThur>: people are lazy farts
<DadminFox>: I dont think water needs promotion 
<DadminFox>: its been around for a long time. We require it
<DadminFox>: my younger coworkers have been saying "Lets get this bread"

<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: rain is a given
<naomi>: Ah shit
<StopTheThur>: you get nados in Louisiana?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: we dont get that too much down here
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: rarely and mainly in the upper boot
<StopTheThur>: ahh
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: might go get me a daquiri and get the inner tube blown up
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: go sit out in the back yard and just let it flood
<GingerGirl_>: Do_it_in_a_Datsun: Do you think your house will flood?
<melagator>: i remember the floods we used to get when i lived in louisiana
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: well i wouldnt be blowing up the inner tube if I wasnt planning on it gingergirl
<melagator>: one time i walked outside and didn't realize i was walking towards the ditch, stepped right intto it and sunk into water up to my waste
<melagator>: waist*
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: thats why I joined IRC. got 5 feet last time. needed something to pass the time while I was rebuilding
<melagator>: our house never flooded. just water about halfway up the yard
<melagator>: we have home videos of hurricane andrew from back in the 90s
<melagator>: my dad is just casually filming the trees in the front yard going practically sideways
<melagator>: (he was filming from inside the house)
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: yup i remember andrew
<melagator>: i was a toddler, don't remember it but the videos are cool
<StopTheThur>: who's andrew
<melagator>: y'all have fires
<melagator>: and earthquakes
<melagator>: you're not safe either
<naomi>: StopTheThur: don’t yall get quakes out the wazoo
<StopTheThur>: actually...
<StopTheThur>: yea my aunt had to move from Thousand oaks for 3 weeks do to the fires
<StopTheThur>: my cousins were STOKED school was cancelled
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: andrew was a hell of a hurricane 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: before katrina and gustav
<naomi>: We get hurricanes and baby earthquakes where I’m from. Live on a small fault line
<melagator>: we get tornadoes up here
<melagator>: i remember when i lived in DFW for the first time and the tornado sirens went off i wasn't sure how serious to take it.  then there was a story in the news of an 18 wheeler being carried off 
<naomi>: Dfw?
<melagator>: dalls-fort worth metroplex
<naomi>: Ah
<melagator>: dallas*
<StopTheThur>: you live there still right melagator? or you moved to Houston?
<melagator>: i'm in dallas. i won't move back to houston if i cna avoid it
<melagator>: don't like that city much
<melagator>: how do i approach a conversation with my boss to ask for a raise?
<StopTheThur>: show him examples of responsibilitiesvs deliverables and how you deserve a raise because X,Y, Z
<StopTheThur>: not sure how to go about CoL raise though
<melagator>: i mean my annual review was all top marks
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: just ask and be ready to back yourself up with as to why you earned it
<melagator>: easy enough
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: or request a performance review
<StopTheThur>: ^
<melagator>: well my last one a few months ago was great. nothing has changed to my knowledge
<melagator>: and had lunch wit hthe owner and he said a raise was coming my way but that was back in janary
<melagator>: january
<melagator>: how long do i wait?
<StopTheThur>: idk I think it depends on the position/location/company/sector
<StopTheThur>: some people get quarterly bonus, some get CoL raises some just a raise due to responsibility/work load
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: well you can always ask to see when they plan on giving it to you
<melagator>: i'm looking at jobs in the area that have similar responsibilities to what i do and they make around 5-10k more than what i make now
<melagator>: and
<melagator>: between you and me
<melagator>: i manage this CRM software that my boss synced his email account to
<melagator>: and i (swear by accident) saw an email from the owner to my boss saying i'm due for a raise but he "has frustrations with me" so timing is important. don't know the frustrations though
<StopTheThur>: XD
<melagator>: why is that impressive? i may not seem so bright when i'm in here but i'm very intelligent. i am shadow banned can vouch for that but he's not around
<StopTheThur>: true I think you're smarter than that
<melagator>: i guess i answered my own question though if i don't seem bright in here
<StopTheThur>: just a trope/meme now
<melagator>: fair
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: well then heres what I would do. go have a closed door talk with your boss
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ask him how are you [mel] doing
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: and if there are any areas in which you can improve
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: be proactive
<melagator>: love that
<melagator>: good advice
<melagator>: thanks
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ive done it plenty of times
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: usually works
<melagator>: i'll wait til next week though
<melagator>: good convo to have at beginning of the week. not on a friday
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Tuesdays or Thursdays
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Mondays not so much
<StopTheThur>: +1 Do_it_in_a_Datsun Tues/Thurs
<melagator>: i like tuesday
<melagator>: thanks for the advice
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: no problem
<StopTheThur>: s/no problem/no problemo
<gonzobot>: Correction, <Do_it_in_a_Datsun> no problemo
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol
<StopTheThur>: oh since you're here Do_it_in_a_Datsun... my car is in the shop and was shopping cars. any considerations for alternatives to the Type R?
<StopTheThur>: i have already been to a few dealerships...
<melagator>: omg car help!
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Golf R, Subbie WRX
<melagator>: i have messed up the side mirrors of my car. both sides
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Mustang Ecoboost
<melagator>: getting it fixed at a dealership is super expensive. what dooooooo
<melagator>: i don't even know where to begin
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Rock Auto, enter your car info, buy mirrors
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: google how to install DIY on youtube
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: should be a 2 hour job at best 
<StopTheThur>: hmm alright I'll look into those
<melagator>: this website is a lot o.o
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Focus RS too StopTheThur 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: mel what car?
<melagator>: 2017 toyota rav4 XLE kind of a purple color
<melagator>: black currant metallic to be exact
<melagator>: i fucked up the mirror itself on the driver side
<melagator>: and the cover of the whole thing on the passenger side AND driver side
<melagator>: backing out of parking spots and it got caught on a pillar. both times...bent mirror backwards and it broke a little
<melagator>: both times
<melagator>: didn't realize i was that close to pillar. whoops
<GingerGirl_>: Are they heated?
<melagator>: i don't think so
<melagator>: i have no idea
<melagator>: how do you tell?
<melagator>: i mean i doubt it
<GingerGirl_>: Because there will be wiring involved if you replace the whole thing
<GingerGirl_>: Well there's usually a button for them
<GingerGirl_>: like to defrost
<melagator>: pretty sure i don't have that
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: there will be a disconnect in the door way if they are heated, so you should find out so that you get the same ones from rock auto
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: but hold on, ill see what I can find
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: XLE usually has heated stuff
<melagator>: if i have a heated button for my mirrors i have had this car for 2 years and not known about it
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol
<melagator>: maybe i just have LE then and not XLE but i thought it was XLE
<StopTheThur>: you don't have the manual or vin #?
<melagator>: i'm sure it's in there somewher
<StopTheThur>: you can tell which model by those lol
<melagator>: i don't have those off the top of my head though
<melagator>: and it says on the back of my car if it's LE or XLE
<melagator>: i just can't remember and i'm not confident now that we are talking about it
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: we had a LE with no heat. DM me on facebook when you figure it out
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: and ill help you find them
<melagator>: you da best
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: thats what I hear
<melagator>: will i be able to get right color?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: not from rock auto. you'd have to get them painted
<GingerGirl_>: Is it just the glass or the whole shebang melagator 
<melagator>: the inside is fine. mirror still adjustable with buttons
<melagator>: but the casing is broken
<melagator>: and left driver mirror itself is fucked
<melagator>: right mirror is fine. just the casing
<GingerGirl_>: Oh ok. Because you can order just the mirror part if that's all it was
<melagator>: yeah i saw that. unfortunately i fucked it up more than that
<melagator>: i mean i was just backing out of parking spots
<melagator>: i hadn't even gotten on the road yet
<melagator>: so just IMAGINE
<melagator>: ;)
<StopTheThur>: word
<melagator>: alright i gotta go focus. bye
<GingerGirl_>: well that was weird
<GingerGirl_>: There's this guy at my office that just came to my desk and talked to me,awkwardly, for like 20 mins
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: brown chicken brown cow
<GingerGirl_>: He's seems so introverted and nerdy, but he's nice. I only ever see him talking to one person
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: maybe hes branching out and you look like a nice person to hold a convo with
<GingerGirl_>: Well of course I do
<GingerGirl_>: Oh gosh
<GingerGirl_>: I just remembered. He asked me yesterday if I wanted to go to lunch
<GingerGirl_>: And I couldn't bc I was leaving early
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: nice!
<GingerGirl_>: No not nice
<GingerGirl_>: I hope he isn't thinking of asking me out
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: you didnt leave early
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: oh
<GingerGirl_>: I hope he's just being nice
<GingerGirl_>: I did leave early. My doggie got a haircut and looks super cute
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ah. you can always passively mention your BF next time
<GingerGirl_>: Yeah I will
<Wishes>: GingerGirl_: does that mean I can't ask you out anymore?

<DadminFox>: Undecided on homework, haha
<StopTheThur>: dang

<StopTheThur>: i need to do that more often i feel like ~once a month isn't enough
<DadminFox>: I usually go every 2 weeks 
<StopTheThur>: indeed
<StopTheThur>: anyways take care
<DadminFox>: Lol
<muffinkins>: I do once a week

<GingerGirl>: Hey heili haven't seen u in a few days
<muffinkins>: Lol
<heili>: Yeah shit's been busy
<heili>: work, train, work, train, eat, sleep
<GingerGirl>: Guys, I'm retarded. But how long does it take someone to get their masters 
<muffinkins>: 1-2 years
<naomi>: ~2 yrs
<muffinkins>: Depending on the program
<blackbird9999>: I wish I went to college
<GingerGirl>: So if they're working full time, prob longer huh
<naomi>: never too late blackbird9999 
<muffinkins>: GingerGirl: yep
<GingerGirl>: Well my guy has decided he's gonna go for his master's rather than a second bachelors. He has a lot of classes, but we aren't sure yet how many it will take to finish the masters
<muffinkins>: Generally it’s uncommon to do that.
<GingerGirl>: So looks like the long distance thing will be awhile. 
<GingerGirl>: He was just tryna figure out which will be quicker
<muffinkins>: A masters is usually pretty intensive so full time you’d get it done faster.
<muffinkins>: What field is he in?
<GingerGirl>: Computer science I think
<GingerGirl>: Programming and shit I don't understand
<techis>: haha GingerGirl 
<naomi>: he would fit right in here lol
<techis>: computer wizardshit
<muffinkins>: Hey techis
<GingerGirl>: Hey techis :)
<muffinkins>: Did you see my message before that college_ was looking for u
<GingerGirl>: He was here then
<GingerGirl>: He responded to her
<muffinkins>: Ohhhh
<muffinkins>: Ok
<techis>: ...why was college looking for me?
<muffinkins>: I maybe was gone then
<techis>: also I saw college ping me but when I got back on college was gone
<GingerGirl>: I think she thought u was in social work like her
<GingerGirl>: I updated my Google keyboard today and now my phone is being weirs
<GingerGirl>: Weird

<muffinkins>: Lol

<techis>: thats cause everyone else has gone phishing
<DadminFox>: lol
<DadminFox>: Our Forensics teacher likes to dock points from me
<DadminFox>: that was supposed to go to discord
<Wishes>: Just got ghosted for the third time in a row
<Wishes>: I love it
<DadminFox>: brutal :/
<Wishes>: I'm not even that mad about it anymore, it's just a constant at this point
<GingerGirl>: This makes no sense
<Wishes>: why GingerGirl 
<GingerGirl>: Bc u shouldn't be ghosted
<GingerGirl>: Hey Hypers0nic 
<Hypers0nic>: evening 
<Wishes>: GingerGirl: just means I'm interesting enough to talk to every day (even for weeks sometimes) but not interesting enough to meet IRL
<DadminFox>: I'm not interested in men, but I'd hang with you
<Wishes>: probabilities mean having 3 in a row happen is improbable but not impossible
<Wishes>: <3 DadminFox 
<DadminFox>: :)
<Wishes>: Men and IRC women like me
<Wishes>: I should move to IRC
<Wishes>: Dunno how long is the trip to it though
<DadminFox>: lol
<GingerGirl>: Wishes it's national nudes day. Tell the ladies they should celebrate
<Wishes>: Isn't everyday national nudes day ;o
<Wishes>: worth a constant celebration in my view
<GingerGirl>: Lol
<Wishes>: I'd prefer to not bother with online dating but with my current job it would never happen, also friends are moving away due to girlfriends/boyfriends and general adult stuff
<Wishes>: hitting me hard rn
<DadminFox>: I feel ya man
<DadminFox>: I'm in the same boat
<DadminFox>: I'm a shy person and I fucked up by constantly focusing on my career or being drunk
<DadminFox>: life moves on, here soon, we can pick up the recently divorced 
<GingerGirl>: Lmao
<GingerGirl>: Such an optimist
<Wishes>: Hmmm
<Wishes>: I get that reference... I think?
<DadminFox>: its not a reference
<DadminFox>: its the truth
<Wishes>: oh I thought you were referring to GingerGirl due to your e-romance ;o 
<Wishes>: mb
<DadminFox>: she tries, I won't give it up
<Wishes>: I'm 24, picking up the recently divorced at my age will be hard ;(
<DadminFox>: oh
<DadminFox>: I'm 30 this year, so I'm watching the marriages fail
<DadminFox>: but going back to that shy thing, its hard for me to meet people
<DadminFox>: life moves on. I'll just work with animals. I like them more than people
<Wishes>: Yeah I feel you DadminFox, same here, and in our field there arent many opportunies without having hobby groups and stuff
<GingerGirl>: He's not wrong

<DadminFox>: GingerGirl doesn't trust me :(
<Wishes>: yo musictau 
<musictau>: You graduated?
<Wishes>: Yeah, in december
<musictau>: Cool cool
<musictau>: Full on software developer?
<Wishes>: DadminFox you did send her a video named Hot Dog 
<DadminFox>: its a fun video
<DadminFox>: its a dude that looks stoned out of his mind calling out to sell hot dogs
<musictau>: GingerGirl: is getting married I heard?
<Wishes>: musictau: indeed, doing some backend and devops/infrastructure work
<musictau>: Wishes: nice nice
<Wishes>: pretty much everything but frontend, but some outsourced team just dumped a frontend project on us so
<musictau>: I’m in charge of Jenkins at work
<musictau>: But mostly backend
<Wishes>: We use jenkins for legacy products
<musictau>: We don’t use git so
<Wishes>: We're mostly all doing our CI/CD on GitLab now
<Wishes>: you don't use git? ;o
<Wishes>: svn?
<musictau>: No
<musictau>: So terrible GUI based whatever
<musictau>: Some*
<musictau>: I set up a git conversion tool, we might switch
<musictau>: But it would be an ordeal
<musictau>: So much custom build bullshit
<musictau>: And monorepo
<Wishes>: Google has a monorepo ;) haha
<musictau>: Yeah, but we’re not google
<Wishes>: but yeah, what company do you work for, a fortune 500 with tons of legacy?
<musictau>: The opposite of that
<musictau>: Well, not really
<musictau>: It’s a 26 person company
<musictau>: Smol af
<Wishes>: would it be considered as a startup
<Wishes>: because looks like old tech a lot
<musictau>: It’s like 17 years old
<musictau>: And profitable
<musictau>: So no
<Wishes>: If you want to work for Hitler hmu
<DadminFox>: ...
<musictau>: Does he pay well?
<musictau>: Oh wait

<DadminFox>: my old coworker works for a ticket resale company. He was telling me about the security practices of his company and I left lunch early because I couldn't take it anymore
<musictau>: DadminFox: oh man
<Wishes>: I work for the european division so y'all are safe

<DadminFox>: I'm not surprised at all
<DadminFox>: but he was telling me how they just write credit card numbers down on paper and don't dispose of them
<Wishes>: wot
<DadminFox>: it was a shit show
<DadminFox>: They dont fall under PCI compliance, some shit loophole
<musictau>: How am I not surprised
<DadminFox>: He asked if I wanted to come work for him at one point since hes the IT manager and I told him they couldn't afford me losing my sanity on week 2
<DadminFox>: plus, I love my current company :)
<DadminFox>: My weekend plans: https://i.imgur.com/1ZqH44q.gifv

<Wishes>: There was a huge (read: HUGE) fuckup in security once due to miscommunication
<musictau>: Once?
<musictau>: I feel like I know the most about security at my company of everyone
<Wishes>: Something that huge only happened once
<Wishes>: Basically, team A said "We're implementing OAuth2 and shit on our B2C components, so your backend Identity services can be disabled/reduced in scope" to team B, so team B complied
<musictau>: O.O
<Wishes>: then team A was told by product that they would not prioritize these changes to authentication, but oops, forgot to tell team B
<Wishes>: anyone could log in on any account as long as you entered a valid password string
<Wishes>: oops
<musictau>: WHAT THE FUCK
<Wishes>: mfw ^ 
<musictau>: Apparently Facebook doesn’t even know how to hash passwords
<musictau>: So we’re all fucked
<Wishes>: luckily it was caught very very early
<Wishes>: some people got fired for it
<Wishes>: hmm, salt
<Wishes>: i c 
<Wishes>: wat u did der
<musictau>: Pepper is also a thing
<musictau>: Lol
<Wishes>: i thought you were referring to password salt
<Wishes>: although I do not know of password pepper :o
<DadminFox>: salt the PW!
<DadminFox>: but don't tell nobody
<Wishes>: I put my salt in my session cache on the client
<Wishes>: am I doing this right DadminFox

<heili>: morning fine friends peoples 
<Hexorg>: Morning heili 
<heili>: i've been at work (from home) for 16 minutes and this dude is already like "Let's start up a call! Pair programming! WOOOOHOOOO"
<Hexorg>: Lol the way you phrase it sounds like spongebob vs squidward
<heili>: I am working with smoeone who loves this because he's a weak ass dev who can't write code
<heili>: which basically means instead of me just writing code... i have to actually tell him what to write. 
<GingerGirl_>: Good morning
<DadminFox>: morning
<Aleteri>: hello
<Aleteri>: hi DadminFox 
<Aleteri>: still have 5 more weeks of OTS
<Aleteri>: I'm on leave for this weekend only 
<DadminFox>: nice. 5 weeks isn't too much
<GingerGirl_>: How's it going so far, Aleteri 
<Aleteri>: not that bad
<Aleteri>: kind of like a really shitty summer camo
<Aleteri>: *Camp
<Aleteri>: hi GingerGirl_ 
<Aleteri>: how have you been doing?
<AndChat|644916>: What's OST?
<Aleteri>: OTS
<DadminFox>: Hex, what happened to you?
<Aleteri>: Officer Training School
<DadminFox>: lol
<DadminFox>: also that song you mentioned is a good song. I get it stuck in my head often
<Hexorg>: Aleteri: ah thanks
<Hexorg>: DadminFox: Hey! Hey! Hey!
<DadminFox>: howdy howdy
<Hexorg>: No the song
<DadminFox>: oh
<DadminFox>: lol

<Naru_>: by they
<Naru_>: I mean the South Korean Airforce
<Naru_>: DadminFox: what does the US army use for wake up music?
<DadminFox>: Reveille
<Aleteri>: you know
<Aleteri>: if you stay away from the computer/smartphone for two months
<Aleteri>: you forget the most basic of passwords
<DadminFox>: disagree
<DadminFox>: lol
<DadminFox>: I was away from tech for almost a year and had no issues there
<Aleteri>: by the way
<Aleteri>: Naru_ was my alt 
<DadminFox>: I put 2 and 2 together when you kept talking about the South Korean Airforce :P
<Aleteri>: apparently switching vpn servers causes the client to disconnect 
<DadminFox>: I believe it breaks the initial connection, but then reinitializes after
<Aleteri>: I wonder if revealing my training schedule breaks any military law
<DadminFox>: not sure, but I'm going to say probably not. A simple google search can reveal many things
<Aleteri>: there's already a blog post about it
<Aleteri>: so probably not 
<Aleteri>: DadminFox: want to know?
<DadminFox>: up to you if you want to share or not. I don't want to you potentially compromise anything
<Aleteri>: week 1~2: the breaking in period+NBC training, week 3: military regulations exam, week 4: CPR exam, week 5: firearms training (full marks)
<DadminFox>: NBC training is always fun
<Aleteri>: especially the part where we go into the room full of mace 
<DadminFox>: I'd rather get tazed than get maced, but I've been maced more times than I can count
<DadminFox>: sucks ass
<Aleteri>: yep
<DadminFox>: I'm drawing a blank on the riot control gas name
<DadminFox>: I'm usually really good about remembering it
<Aleteri>: tear gas?
<DadminFox>: oh
<DadminFox>: CS gas
<DadminFox>: lol
<Aleteri>: yeah
<DadminFox>: I have immunity to that :)
<Aleteri>: it was CS gas 
<Aleteri>: lucky you
<DadminFox>: I hated it at first, now i can sit in it and be fine
<Aleteri>: I couldn't see straight when I went in
<DadminFox>: When I was about 6 months out from leaving the regular Army, I got put in a different company to help them out. I was assigned under an NBC NCO, so she had me hanging out in the chamber often when she was running it for other companies
<DadminFox>: its not so bad once you adjust to it
<Aleteri>: what did you to piss her off 
<DadminFox>: nothing
<DadminFox>: She loved me
<Aleteri>: hmm
<DadminFox>: I take most things as a challenge
<DadminFox>: so she would fuck with me and I'd bite back
<Aleteri>: week 7: watered-down ranger training 
<Aleteri>: and here I am 
<DadminFox>: on IRC
<DadminFox>: :P

<GingerGirl_>: Pretty decent. Nothing too interesting
<DadminFox>: Not too bad. Just been doing work and school stuff. Studying for certifications and learning how to ice skate 
<Aleteri>: nice
<Aleteri>: dammit 
<Aleteri>: it was always lights out at 2200
<Aleteri>: now I feel drowsy
<DadminFox>: Heh
<DadminFox>: Since you still have time in training, I'd advise against deviating from the normal hours too much 
<Aleteri>: probably 
<Aleteri>: since the drill lieutenants will revive hell week to straighten us up again

<melagator>: chores, one of those group paint night things, rock climbing
<DadminFox>: that sounds fgun
<naomi>: Easter
<DadminFox>: fun*
<melagator>: should be!
<melagator>: debating if i want to participate in any 420 fun with my friends for the paint night thing
<melagator>: they're taking edibles and said i'm welcome to have some but idk if i'm feelin it
<DadminFox>: I don't really like the way I feel if I do it, but the sleep that comes with it is amazing
<melagator>: oh and i have plans to go over and do some fun spanking bdsm-y stuff with a guy i haven't seen in like, 2 years lol he lives an hour or so away and is a cop so his work schedule sucks. makes getting together challenging
<DadminFox>: ahh that sucks, but sounds like fun soon!
<melagator>: if i go through with it
<melagator>: also on the fence about that
<DadminFox>: ahh
<melagator>: mostly cause of the drive
<DadminFox>: Oh, I thought he'd be driving towards you
<melagator>: nah i don't want him at my place
<DadminFox>: lol, why not?
<melagator>: i'm not big on having people over in general. for me it's kind of a big deal to bring someone over that isn't family
<GingerGirl_>: Hey Mel, You up for a girl question?
<melagator>: always
<DadminFox>: I guess she doesnt want to ask or shes PMing it
<melagator>: PM ;)

<DadminFox>: Questions? Depends. Most I find annoying because in IRC or Reddit its the same few questions :P

<DadminFox>: I am
<Wishes>: I'm looking to replace my old decrepit 2013 build, and I'm wondering if I should wait for any new stuff coming up
<DadminFox>: Depends. The current tech is really good
<GingerGirl_>: Buenos dias Wishes 
<DadminFox>: What are your goals?
<Wishes>: bon matin GingerGirl_ 
<DadminFox>: Just games? Virtualization? Password cracking? 
<Wishes>: Gaming mostly, also some programming on spare time, and general (youtube, etc) use

<DadminFox>: I'm running a GTX 1080 Ti Founders edition, it does a killer job
<Wishes>: You have more money than I do then ;p
<DadminFox>: whoa, 2060 is cheaper than expected 
<Wishes>: it's in canadian dollars
<DadminFox>: nah, I built this PC over time
<DadminFox>: I got really lucky during the crypto-boom. I caught Nvidia selling the 1080Ti at MSRP
<DadminFox>: so I sold my previous card for about $100 less than I bought it for
<Wishes>: oshit
<DadminFox>: Yeah, definitely lucky
<DadminFox>: Are you married to nVidia cards?
<DadminFox>: I hear good things about AMD
<Wishes>: So yeah, i've put that build together, I'd rather it hover around CAD$1,200 to 1,400
<DadminFox>: What equipment are you planning on transferring? Do you need an OS?
<Wishes>: I'd rather use AMDs due to me dual booting with Linux (and I'd like to switch over), but Vegas are more expensive than the RTX 2060 and has worse performance per dollar
<DadminFox>: ahh got it
<Wishes>: I have a 4k 27" IPS monitor (dont plan on going 4K60fps though), a corsair k70 red keyboard
<Wishes>: and a basic optical mouse from MS, so most peripherals are already accounted for
<Wishes>: I'd like a Win10 pro key but it's expensive I find :/
<DadminFox>: In school currently?
<Wishes>: unfortunately not
<Wishes>: I'm also wondering if I should wait for Zen2 or if it's going to be for nothing due to overhyping
<DadminFox>: not really sure to be honest
<DadminFox>: I haven't thought much about parts, but I'm putting a small build idea together
<techis>: DadminFox: build your nas yet? :P
<DadminFox>: shut up
<DadminFox>: lol
<techis>: no
<Wishes>: DadminFox: you're changing your parts soon as well?
<DadminFox>: I am not, techis is just being a dick

<DadminFox>: different card, different RAM
<DadminFox>: added a CPU cooler, yours didn't have one
<DadminFox>: ^ this is what I meant by putting a small build idea together :P
<DadminFox>: the RAM selected is cheaper and similar to the previous. I use that RAM and have no issues whatsoever
<Wishes>: I see! I didn't put one because I had heard that ryzens had okay stock coolers compared to Intel
<DadminFox>: I just don't trust stock :P
<Wishes>: I see you changed the gpu, will I have problems with the mini ITX version?
<Wishes>: or is it more underpowered? idk
<DadminFox>: oh I have no idea
<DadminFox>: I was just going with price at the moment
<DadminFox>: I haven't done much research in the new GPUs. I don't really plan on upgrading mine for another 3 years or so

<StopTheFri>: well I am a boob guy
<StopTheFri>: weekend plans melagator?
<melagator>: well the changed from what i told DadminFox earlier
<melagator>: tonight is chores and errands and things
<melagator>: tomorrow is gym, then painting at one of those paint night things, then probably gonna see a guy about a booty call
<melagator>: sunday WAS rock climbing but now i'm getting my eyebrows microbladed so i may skip the rock climbing 
<StopTheFri>: WTH
<StopTheFri>: You told me no more dickstractions
<StopTheFri>: also YOU'RE SKIPPING OUT ON CLIMBING
<melagator>: it's not a relationship thing
<melagator>: it's a hookup
<melagator>: v different
<DadminFox>: That's because she was tired of seeing your penis
<techis>: AHAHAHA
<StopTheFri>: i guess so
<melagator>: dating is off the table
<melagator>: i'll probably still climb before the appointment
<melagator>: i just need to plan my day right
<StopTheFri>: nice
<StopTheFri>: climbing gym right?
<GingerGirl_>: I'm pretty sure Mel's or anyone else's sex life isn't really your concern
<StopTheFri>: i guess so
<techis>: ....
<melagator>: StopTheFri yes climbing gym
<melagator>: no where outside to climb around here
<StopTheFri>: maybe bouldering, but I do remember you saying it was pretty scarce for outdoor climbing
<StopTheFri>: and Texas is kinda flat...
<melagator>: i mean there are places in texas i'm sure you can do that but no where near the metroplex
<melagator>: maybe somewhere like big bend
<melagator>: but that's 8 or so hours away
<StopTheFri>: really? that's crazy. some of our municipal parks are big enough to have rocky formations and climbing available
<StopTheFri>: but yea outdoors is a little different
<StopTheFri>: wait have you tried it before?
<melagator>: tried what?
<melagator>: outdoor climbing or indoor climbing?
<melagator>: i've been indoor climbing a handful of times
<StopTheFri>: just rock climbing in general
<StopTheFri>: oh
<StopTheFri>: .hi5 melagator
<gonzobot>: StopTheFri starts to give melagator a high five, but leaves them hanging
<melagator>: it's not really a regular hobby but fun to do from time to time
<melagator>: kinda like kayaking or paddle boarding
<StopTheFri>: i see
<melagator>: but i'm not gonna go this sunday. not gonna work with my plans
<melagator>: oh oh oh i'm picking up an american sign language for beginners book today!
<StopTheFri>: naomi could probably help you there lol
<melagator>: does she know ASL?
<StopTheFri>: she's studying it?
<naomi>: I’m fluent
<melagator>: that's awesome
<StopTheFri>: there you go
<melagator>: i want to learn it
<naomi>: Hmu
<melagator>: hmu?
<naomi>: Its my career
<naomi>: Hit me up
<melagator>: oh lol
<naomi>: If u need help
<melagator>: for sure!!
<melagator>: StopTheFri what do you have going on this weekend?
<naomi>: You’re in tx right?
<melagator>: yes ma'am
<StopTheFri>: It's all climbing related lol
<naomi>: Pretty big Deaf community down that way
<melagator>: yeah?
<StopTheFri>: climbing session with a reddit friend tonight
<melagator>: am i allowed to get involved even though i'm not deaf?
<StopTheFri>: maybe do bouldering Sat
<naomi>: melagator: yup, as long as you make an effort to learn and respect the culture
<StopTheFri>: then Sunday morning is a weekly top-rope gym
<melagator>: that's the goal
<melagator>: what is top rope, StopTheFri?
<naomi>: Texas school for the deaf is in austin, idk where you’re at but they likely have lots of resources and events
<melagator>: i'm in dallas
<naomi>: How far is that?
<melagator>: few hours
<StopTheFri>: top rope is a kind of aid climbing when you use a rope that's fixed to the top of a climb
<melagator>: ah
<StopTheFri>: this is different from free climbing or lead climbing
<StopTheFri>: which the rope is fixed as you go
<melagator>: naomi there's a "deaf ahead" crossing sign near me. first and only one i've seen in my life
<naomi>: Theres probably stuff in dallas. Big cities = usually higher populstion of deaf community
<melagator>: not sure if it means there's a community around or what but i'm intrigued
<naomi>: Search facebook for deaf groups near dallas, there will surely be something!
<melagator>: StopTheFri what kind of clmbing is most difficult?
<StopTheFri>: that's hard to answer since there's a lot of different kinds of climbing
<StopTheFri>: but I would probably say traditional big wall climbing
<StopTheFri>: Like Half-dome/El capitan
<StopTheFri>: or alpine climbing....
<Hexorg>: StopTheFri: why did you thank me?
<StopTheFri>: i didn't read my .showtells or w/e and gonzobot sent me this
<StopTheFri>: https://i.imgur.com/cVQlx3I.jpg
<Hexorg>: Oh haha yeah
<StopTheFri>: sadly you can replace SF with LA or any major metropolitan area
<maxle>: do other cities really have as much sidewalk poop and heroin needles as SF
<Hexorg>: Yeah idk I havnt smelled excrement in Boston all that much
<Hexorg>: Maybe while passing some shady block
<Hexorg>: I'd say on paths I walk 98% are clean
<StopTheFri>: not sure if it's anecdotally but I smell shit all the time my metro
<StopTheFri>: I took it late night once and there was dude at stop straight up pissing in the corner
<Hexorg>: Huh
<StopTheFri>: some guys shooting up a few feet away from them
<Hexorg>: I saw a dead hobo once. But never poop
<StopTheFri>: really?
<Hexorg>: Yeah

<Hexorg>: If he gets drunk - yes
<Hexorg>: StopTheFri, my high school buddy is visiting me this week and he said he'll buy me a track suit if I take a picture in it whie squatting
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Moscow makes me want to live in a big city though. It seems like so much fun

<Hexorg>: I'll do it if he buys it
<StopTheFri>: nicee
<StopTheFri>: .hi5 Hexorg
<gonzobot>: StopTheFri gives Hexorg a friendly high five
<StopTheFri>: TheRealMcFoy2: I think it depends on the type of city/country
<StopTheFri>: as much as I like LA, idk other cities seemed cooler
<StopTheFri>: but maybe it's just novelty and 'grass is greener'
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I just like that the public transport is decent, and there’s so many places to go
<Hexorg>: well.. Moscow if filled with people who can afford living in Moscow
<Hexorg>: so it's kinda like a self-segregating community

<Hexorg>: TheRealMcFoy2, to be fair no russian will be able to tell accents apart
<Hexorg>: heck most of them can't tell US vs UK accents
<TheRealMcFoy2>: That’s fair,  I’m more concerned with American girls at this point though
<Hexorg>: Well you're not gonna find American girls in Russia that's for sure
<naomi>: People love southern accents
<StopTheFri>: if you like southern check out datsuns'
<StopTheFri>: his is crazy

<Hexorg>: I was also joking about notifications
<StopTheFri>: i thought open offices actually decrease productivity
<Hexorg>: they do when they are unwanted
<StopTheFri>: hmm
<StopTheFri>: i see
<Hexorg>: but if you code block A and I code block B and A and B supposed to work together it's a lot faster to just talk about it than sending emails
<StopTheFri>: oh yea true
<StopTheFri>: that's interesting, I don't code for production per se but I usually just ask my coworker how to do it/and just modify how i like it

<Hexorg>: Yeah I do. I had two brand new Samsung S6 last and they both broke the same way in less than a year
<Hexorg>: I had this one for 2 years now and it took as much of a beating and still works just fine
<StopTheFri>: oh dang
<naomi>: Thats a yikes from me
<Hexorg>: and naturally Samsung said the water damage indicator was triggered and woudn't fix it... even though the problem was that screen just wouldn't turn on
<Hexorg>: I think internally a plug must've just got disconnected.
<StopTheFri>: yea phone companies....
<Hexorg>: but yeah LG is great. I really like the wide angle photo lense
<StopTheFri>: nice
<StopTheFri>: i'm still not sure what my new phone will be

<StopTheFri>: 6 is really nice
<StopTheFri>: 7 is meh
<StopTheFri>: 8 is okay
<naomi>: maybe its the 6s or sth
<naomi>: one of the 6's has a bunch of issues
<StopTheFri>: and only rich moneybags or musictau have X or XS+
<naomi>: i could deal w not having a headphone jack when listening to music on my own, but i cant connect bluetooth to my car
<naomi>: lolol
<naomi>: i want a rose gold one whenever i get a new phone
<Hexorg>: Yeah my g6 is 2 years old and unless something breaks I don't think I'll get anything new any time soon

<Hexorg>: All you crazy fellas can't deny
<Hexorg>: When you multiply two primes and subtract one and then raise it to power 15 you get encryption
<techis>: Hexorg: signed or unsigned?
<techis>: :P
<Hexorg>: Unsigned
<Hexorg>: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)
<gonzobot>: Title: RSA (cryptosystem) - Wikipedia
<Hexorg>: I think big ints are normally unsigned

<naomi>: not i
<naomi>: soz
<techis>: ish
<snoo54>: u think it is worth it to quit a 70k/yr job at 25 to get a master degree (1 year program)
<techis>: probably not, but its really up to you. could you do your masters part time while working?
<techis>: or get work to pay for it?
<techis>: also r/personalfinance is probably a better place to ask
<naomi>: Welp
<naomi>: He back
<DadminFox>: Im excited to go to my parents tomorrow. Mostly because I want to see if they have something of mine from a few years ago
<DadminFox>: but I also like my parents
<GingerGirl>: Is this thing gonna be easy to find?
<DadminFox>: I hope so
<DadminFox>: I just started playing my favorite series again. I'm really hoping I left the other game there because it has 3 games in the series on the disc 
<DadminFox>: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/JHuZedd5/5J6UjIA.jpg
<DadminFox>: I feel like a kid right now
<GingerGirl>: What game is it
<GingerGirl>: G is looking exhausted
<DadminFox>: Metal Gear Solid
<DadminFox>: Its one of the few series that I am glued to from start to finish. Its where my tattoo is from :D
<GingerGirl>: Ahh
<DadminFox>: #geeklife
<Hexorg>: I never played any metal gear games :-/
<DadminFox>: I love them
<DadminFox>: I recommend them. I feel like they pass the test of time considering I still play them
<DadminFox>: but they are not for everyone and the storyline can be a bit confusing
<Hexorg>: Yeah they are supernatural right?
<DadminFox>: somewhat, but its not the primary basis
<Hexorg>: Ah
<DadminFox>: Metal Gear Solid 2 predicted the future, lol
<Hexorg>: Are there a lot of stealth mechanics?
<DadminFox>: Its a stealth game, but not required
<Hexorg>: Hmm
<DadminFox>: Im doing a speed run of MGS1, but my controller needs to charge
<DadminFox>: I'm about 40% in the game with 1:15
<Hexorg>: I just know I lately havnt had enough patience for stealth games
<DadminFox>: at the average play time, it would be about hour 5-7 to get where I am
<DadminFox>: A lot of people dont like Metal Gear Solid 1 because its old and the graphics didnt hold up
<DadminFox>: I really dont care. I LOVE the story :)
<Hexorg>: It's PS1 right?
<DadminFox>: yeah
<DadminFox>: PS1, then MGS 2 & 3 were PS2, Peace Walker was PSP, MGS 4 was PS4, MGS5 was PS4/PC/XBONE
<DadminFox>: MGS5 was the only one I haven't finished 
<Hexorg>: Gotcha
<Hexorg>: I own 5 on pc
<DadminFox>: Ground Zeroes or Phantom Pain?
<DadminFox>: Ground Zeroes was cool because it showed off the Fox engine 
<Hexorg>: Phantom pain I think
<DadminFox>: Phantom Pain is the longer game
<DadminFox>: GZ can be finished in under 7 minutes if you know what to do
<Hexorg>: It took me like an hour to get out of the hospital
<DadminFox>: yeah, but those cut scenes were cool
<Hexorg>: Yup
<DadminFox>: Metal Gear is like 10 movies with some game play
<Hypers0nic>: phantom pain is one of the best games ive ever played tbh
<Hypers0nic>: although the story is really quite odd
<Hypers0nic>: even for a kojima gae
<Hypers0nic>: game
<DadminFox>: I just really appreciate how MGS1 referenced all of the other games, multiple years before they came out
<DadminFox>: yet MGS1 made sense, but once MGS3 came out, everything was like HOLY FUCK
<Hexorg>: Good holy fuck or bad?
<DadminFox>: AMAZING
<Hypers0nic>: mgs1 is like star wars episode iv

<Hexorg>: Uhhh
<Hexorg>: You need to shower
<DadminFox>: not falling off
<DadminFox>: lol
<DadminFox>: not dandruff either
<DadminFox>: you're either fucking with me or haven't heard the term salt and pepper when it comes to hair :P
<Hexorg>: Oh... I havnt 
<Hexorg>: Havnt heard
<DadminFox>: grey hairs
<DadminFox>: among the regular hair
<Hexorg>: Oh!!!!!
<Hexorg>: I thought salt and pepper from food accumulated in your beard
<DadminFox>: LOL
<Hexorg>: Sorry
<DadminFox>: my biological dad has more grey hairs than natural color and he looks pretty damn good. I'm hoping I get those genes
<DadminFox>: though my biological mom has her natural hair color still
<Hexorg>: There's humorous saying in Russia - "until 1mm is not dirt. And if more it'll just fall off on its own"
<DadminFox>: lol, interesting
<naomi>: Happy easter yall
<Hexorg>: Y'easter
<DadminFox>: coffee is done
<DadminFox>: woo

<Hexorg>: And kitty cuddles 
<DadminFox>: I woke up and surprisingly not hungover
<DadminFox>: uhh
<DadminFox>: played Slav Armada, made coffee, and fed the dog
<DadminFox>: thats about it
<Hexorg>: Lol what is this armada of slavs
<DadminFox>: one of those cookie clicker style games
<Hexorg>: Ah ok
<DadminFox>: your primary Slav squats always. He kicks and kicks some more. When he maxes out his bar, he gets Vodka
<DadminFox>: the more vodka the stronger he gets, then you recruit additional Slavs to invade the world
<DadminFox>: its very stereotypical, but I suppose this is the worlds understanding of that part of the world
<DadminFox>: I need to get homework done before noon
<DadminFox>: I really don't want to write a paper on features of Microsoft Edge. I don't and won't ever use it

<TheCat5001>: happy easter
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Morning y’all
<naomi>: Wb TheRealMcFoy2
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Thanks. Back in central time. Waiting on my last flight in Chicago
<naomi>: So how was your trip?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Loads of fun, exhausting and probably a bit too long. I was there a week and a half, but after about a week I was really missing my own bed. I did get to see a lot more with those extra couple days
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m really glad I got to go. Meet all my sisters friends and see how life is over there
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Russia loves statues, so I got to see a bunch of those. It’s interesting seeing the difference between Moscow and Chicago though, just the little things
<GingerGirl_>: What time is your flight? Are you checking out the city?
<DadminFox>:  o/
<TheRealMcFoy2>: On my flight now, leaves at 820. I had an overnight layover and just crashed with my buddy in the city. Just kinda racked out cause I was supper jet lagged.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: If I had a few more days I would have checked it out, but I’ve visited Chicago before. It’s definitely a city I wouldn’t mind living in
<DadminFox>: Chicago is an interesting place
<DadminFox>: I wouldnt mind living on the outskirts of it
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I think I’d like Chicago better than New York for sure, but I only visited New York on a field trip in high school
<DadminFox>: Never been to NY, but I think I'd agree
<DadminFox>: I've never lived in a large city, so the thought does not appeal to me
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’m kinda toying with the idea of moving to a big city, the one I’m in right now is only 200k and pretty spread out
<TheRealMcFoy2>: It’s cool because there’s so many options for everything like bars and restaurants.
<DadminFox>: true, but the cost of living goes up along with the cost of eating unhealthy or spending a lot of time/money at bars
<TheRealMcFoy2>: That’s true. It would take a decent raise to get me to move to a more expensive city. I liked Moscow cause it was dirt cheap for my salary.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Expensive for Russians, cheap for me
<TheRealMcFoy2>: But a lot of that is the exchange rate
<naomi>: Nyc is tough
<DadminFox>: I'd like to live in the country area, close enough to a city to not be out of the loop, but far enough away to be in the quiet
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Yo @naomi, I may try to take my next solo vacation to New England and see some of those cities, which cities would you prioritize
<naomi>: Boston
<TheRealMcFoy2>: @DadminFox: you would love the city of Madison near me. I have some coworkers with 2-6 acres and a 30 minute commute to work and the city
<naomi>: Vermont is beautiful as well
<naomi>: Or cape cod
<naomi>: Mystic CT is popular. If you were to go to Mystic id recommend you go to Niantic as well which is a hidden gem a few towns over on the same highway
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I’ll try to plan for those. Won’t be able to go anytime soon, but it’s never too early to start planning.
<DadminFox>: I need to travel more, its been a while
<naomi>: Its super easy to roadtrip new england bc its pretty small
<naomi>: Except maine
<naomi>: Lots of airport options too

<musictau>: melagator: who are you
<musictau>: Hexorg: don’t make me compile ur face
<musictau>: DadminFox: “I use arch because I like having excuses for getting nothing done”
<melagator>: musictau!
<melagator>: omg
<melagator>: long time no see
<musictau>: ಠ_ಠ
<melagator>: .hug musictau
<gonzobot>: melagator gives musictau a well-deserved hug :)
<DadminFox>: I haven't attempted to use Arch yet
<DadminFox>: doesn't really interest me in my current stage. No time to build
<UnstableFlux>: this weed i picked up today was packaged on 4/20
<musictau>: I use macOS because I like having a Unix system, with good commercial applications, and it doesn’t break all the time
<UnstableFlux>: that's about it
<musictau>: That being said Ubuntu’s supposedly pretty good
<StopTheMon>: oh hi melagator
<StopTheMon>: what made you decide not to?
<StopTheMon>: DID YOU CLIMB?
<StopTheMon>: yo musictau how's work been?
<musictau>: It’s been decent
<musictau>: Minus windows, which can go fuck itself
<StopTheMon>: bwahahaha
<melagator>: StopTheMon i did not go climbing, no
<melagator>: i didn't go to that guy's house though
<melagator>: musictau what are you up to these days? how's lifting?
<melagator>: StopTheMon i know, i know. i couldn't go through with it. i have my climbing dates picked out though. need to go before i lose the groupon lol
<musictau>: Working mostly
<musictau>: Lifting is okay, getting back up there the past month or so
<musictau>: Body weight is up finally
<StopTheMon>: melagator: aight. I'm going to hold you to your climbing promises
<musictau>: Yay instant pot lol
<musictau>: I do shakes for breakfast
<musictau>: Starting to do chicken and rice
<musictau>: Going to eat so much rice
<musictau>: And chicken
<StopTheMon>: funny thing I was at a cookout about a month ago and I was like OMFG, and people were like dude it's okay to have more than chicken/broccolii/rices
<melagator>: i've come to terms with the fact that i need to stop being lazy and just cook my own food
<melagator>: so i'll be joining you on the chicken and rice wagon, musictau
<StopTheMon>: aww yee melagator
<StopTheMon>: #FITLYFEMASTERRACE
<musictau>: Yassss
<melagator>: i just hate cooking
<melagator>: ugh
<musictau>: Same
<melagator>: i guess one day a week of meal prep won't kill me though
<StopTheMon>: is it do to the time consuming part?
<musictau>: Eh, probably will
<melagator>: and i can better control my macros
<musictau>: melagator: buy and instant pot
<melagator>: can you cook rice?
<musictau>: I just throw in chicken or rice
<musictau>: Yeah
<melagator>: maybe i will ask for one for my bda
<StopTheMon>: ^
<melagator>: bday
<musictau>: It just comes out done
<StopTheMon>: when's your bday?
<melagator>: june 5
<melagator>: just texted sister and told her if the siblings wanna do a gift for my 30th to get me an instant pot
<StopTheMon>: curse your Asian Doctoer bF
<melagator>: lol
<StopTheMon>: s/your/her
<gonzobot>: Correction, <StopTheMon> curse her Asian Doctoer bF
<melagator>: i knew what you meant
<StopTheMon>: I know
<melagator>: did you?
<melagator>: ARE YOU SURE?
<StopTheMon>: yes, wait
<StopTheMon>: yes
<melagator>: i have a job interview on thursday
<StopTheMon>: .hi5 melagator
<gonzobot>: StopTheMon makes as if to high five melagator but pulls their hand away at the last second
<StopTheMon>: where?
<melagator>: architecture firm
<StopTheMon>: wait does it require you to dress up?
<melagator>: the job or the interview?
<melagator>: i'm working with a stylist to update my wardrobe so either way i'm fine
<musictau>: melagator: what’s your SSN?
<melagator>: unfortunately the working world doesn't let me wear leggings and hoodies every day
<UnstableFlux>: yes it does
<UnstableFlux>: you jsut need to find the right place :P
<UnstableFlux>: just*
<musictau>: I wear jeans and a t shirt
<melagator>: let me rephrase
<melagator>: the working world i am in
<musictau>: melagator is a little bitch
<StopTheMon>: LOL
<melagator>: :(
<StopTheMon>: .hi5 musictau
<gonzobot>: StopTheMon tries to give musictau a five up high but misses. that was awkward
<melagator>: HA
<melagator>: instant karma
<StopTheMon>: Yea I was saying about the dressing up melagator
<UnstableFlux>: I'm an associate director of a 45 person department and I show up in jeans and a t-shirt most days 
<musictau>: melagator: no balls
<StopTheMon>: I feel most don't do it
<melagator>: i guess it depends on what you mean by dress up
<StopTheMon>: wears*...
<melagator>: i imagine it will probably be business casual
<StopTheMon>: i'd assume at the very least
<melagator>: UnstableFlux that must be nice
<StopTheMon>: guess it would depend on the clients too
<StopTheMon>: UnstableFlux: but you're basically in tech
<StopTheMon>: not everything is tech
<melagator>: since i am interviewing for a marketing role which is client facing i'll need to spruce it up
<StopTheMon>: you still rocking the 'let me see your manager' haircut?
<StopTheMon>: XD
<melagator>: i told you, i'm growing it out!
<melagator>: it's almost to my chin
<musictau>: YES
<melagator>: actually, it's really not ideal interview hair
<musictau>: \o/
<gonzobot>: FUCK YEAH!
<melagator>: but it's what i got to work with
<musictau>: I need to cut my hair lol
<StopTheMon>: isn't your hair not jesus levels anymore
<musictau>: It’s slightly below sternum or so
<melagator>: https://imgur.com/a/HdBpv1d i haven't straightened it since november. taht was taken last week
<gonzobot>: Title: Imgur: The magic of the Internet
<melagator>: so, yeah. i got a mop. but can't cut it soooo i'll have to work with it
<StopTheMon>: honestly melagator its looks eons better than the manager cut already
<melagator>: lolol
<melagator>: that's a matter of personal preference i think but i appreciate that
<StopTheMon>: also you look much closer to your sister in that pic
<melagator>: so hotter? YES
<melagator>: i'll be glad when it's long
<melagator>: and not in the in between stage
<StopTheMon>: musictau: so you're saying you cut it once this entire time i knew you?
<melagator>: musictau wait. your hair is slightly below your sternum??
<StopTheMon>: why'd you cut it again?
<musictau>: melagator: yeah
<musictau>: Something like that
<GingerGirl_>: probably longer
<melagator>: lordy
<melagator>: i'm just trying to get to my shoulders
<musictau>: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/oylDUybS/IMG_3809.JPG

<StopTheMon>: Cut that shit

<melagator>: myself included
<naomi>: melagator: ur hair cute af
<melagator>: awh thanks naomi! <3
<naomi>: Mine would finally be considered a bob now
<melagator>: i think if i straightened it, it might be a bob
<StopTheMon>: naomi: so now is it "can I see your manager" bob?
<naomi>: musictau: how short would you cut it
<naomi>: StopTheMon: its a bit longer than that now
<melagator>: and would also look horribly uneven since i've been cutting it myself inbetween actual cuts lol
<melagator>: but with curls you can't tell \o/
<gonzobot>: HUAH!
<musictau>: naomi: like short
<naomi>: Do i want to speak to your manager? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/HKQYnNeJ/IMG_1606.JPG

<GingerGirl_>: My guy may come see me this weekend. This would be a big step. I'm still not going to let him park his car at my house
<melagator>: why is that a big step? does he not live near you?
<GingerGirl_>: Nope and the fact my ex has threatened to kill him mulitple times
<naomi>: GingerGirl_: did your ex move out yet?

<GingerGirl_>: I need a side hustle
<baumy>: something about the phrase "side hustle" makes me irrationally angry
<GingerGirl_>: Why
<GingerGirl_>: I don't want a second job, but would like to do something on the side to earn extra cash
<baumy>: i think almost everyone i hear use that phrase is hawking mlm crap
<baumy>: even saying you do something "on the side" or "side gig" instead of "side hustle" doesn't trigger that response for me

<StopTheTues>: I had no one to yell BEGONE THOT at
<StopTheTues>: i throw them at naomi
<naomi>: i eat them
<StopTheTues>: and occasionally i get them stolen only to get pelted by others
<batsteph>: they make pretty good soup i've heard naomi 
<naomi>: i sometimes spear StopTheTues 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: id spear him too ;-)
<StopTheTues>: oh hey Do_it_in_a_Datsun

<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: we'd make cute semi-asian babies
<StopTheTues>: yes. semi-asian babies turn out well
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: dammit, they should make it a felony to get in a wreck on the interstate in Baton Rouge
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: its a damned straight line
<StopTheTues>: texting and driving is bad
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Louisiana drivers are dumb as well
<muffinkins>: Hello
<StopTheTues>: Hola
<skittle>: Do_it_in_a_Datsun, indiana took a pretty great approach to reducing texting and driving
<skittle>: they simply never fix the road so you have to stay alert to avoid potholes
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: execution?
<skittle>: no one texts
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ah
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: we are well on our way
<thebananaking>: someone once said that the best driver safety device would be a 12-inch steel spike in the middle of every steering wheel
<skittle>: its why everyone here drives trucks, if your car is lower than 6 inches you're gonna bottom out just going to the grocery store
<DadminFox>: thats terrifying
<skittle>: lets be real DadminFox nebraska has the worst roads i have ever driven on
<skittle>: the second i crossed into iowa the ride improved noticeably 
<DadminFox>: Gross, Iowa
<DadminFox>: lol
<skittle>: iowa is so cute
<DadminFox>: theres a reason why we are rated the top 5 worst roads to drive on 
<skittle>: they take pretty good care of the roads and they are always trying to show off their rest stops
<DadminFox>: Iowa has some slick rest stops
<skittle>: like PLEASE stop in iowa!!!!! PELASE!!!!!!!!
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: buccees 
<GingerGirl>: skittle: you're not wrong
<skittle>: i know
<skittle>: i'm never wrong

<TheRealMcFoy2>: What’s up y’all?
<naomi>: sup TheRealMcFoy2 
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Found out my cousin’s fiancée broke off their engagement socthats fun
<naomi>: aw damn
<TheRealMcFoy2>: I thought it was inevitable tbh
<naomi>: for the better?
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Because he was babies as a kid and refuses to compromise, and she was tired of supporting both of them while he followed his dreams to be in a band that made no money
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Babied*
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Yeah, probably for the best
<naomi>: oof.
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Exactly. She put up with it longer than I could have
<naomi>: good for her to break it then
<naomi>: i have a somewhat random topic for discussion today
<TheRealMcFoy2>: She’s trying to go active duty Air Force, to support them. He didn’t want to deal with the distance though
<TheRealMcFoy2>: What topic? I could use a distraction
<naomi>: i ate a confusing piece of cheesecake today
<naomi>: its from one of the dining places on campus and its.... like. fluffy?
<naomi>: very confusing. mentioned it to my mom and she goes "it must not be new york style then."
<TheRealMcFoy2>: News to me too
<naomi>: a cheesecake is supposed to be dense no?
<naomi>: heavy. solid
<naomi>: the ones here are creamy and crumbly almost?
<naomi>: thats all ive got
<GingerGirl>: It was probably a no bake cheesecake
<naomi>: hmm, idk. the tops were all slightly browned

<GingerGirl_>: Would have thought you realized that by now
<techis>: lol
<skittle>: hi
<techis>: hows everyones wednesday?
<skittle>: musictau is one of the only people here i listen to 
<skittle>: the rest of you are pretty boring
<Steven__>: kinda shitty
<musictau>: techis: pretty good
<musictau>: skittle: :)
<StopTheWed>: sup Cav
<techis>: Steven__: hopefully a temporary shitty?
<Steven__>: sorta
<Steven__>: I got nicegirled the other day it was wild
<Steven__>: but at work Ive lost all faith in my chain of command and its really disheartening to know you cant even trust the people you work for in the slightest
<Steven__>: especially when you know there will be repercussions if you go over their heads
<UnstableFlux>: nicegirled...?
<Steven__>: yeah I told this girl "Hey I
<Steven__>: I think we should stop seeing each other yada yada
<Steven__>: after 1 date
<Steven__>: she asked why
<Steven__>: before I could answer just a flurry of "your dicks small youre ugly other girls probably laugh at you
<techis>: ouch that sucks
<Trezker>: Well, seems you were correct in your judgement
<Steven__>: yeah
<Steven__>: I told her I hope she finds someone as miserable as her then blocked her number
<UnstableFlux>: that's not at all what I was expecting 
<UnstableFlux>: Isn't a 'nice guy' the one who gets stuck in the friendzone/white knights?
<UnstableFlux>: so would nicegirled be the same thing?
<UnstableFlux>: either way that's shitty man
<Steven__>: kinda but theyre also known to do the same thing
<Steven__>: get rejected and lash out
<musictau>: ^
<UnstableFlux>: But hey at least people are interested in you
<Trezker>: a nice guy is someone who expects things in return for being nice
<Steven__>: yeah it sucks but if youre reaction to rejection is to lash out at someone you probably got some real self esteem issues
<DadminFox>: 3 people told me. Hahaha
<UnstableFlux>: ah yeah that's what it was
<Steven__>: so Im not too worked up about its just wild first time thats happened to me
<Trezker>: then they get pissed when they don't ge what they "paid for"
<Steven__>: dating is wild, man
<Steven__>: also damian lillard is colder than a yeti eating frozen spaghetti
<StopTheWed>: <Steven__dating> is wild, man: you don't say?
<StopTheWed>: XD
<musictau>: 3:14:24 PM — UnstableFlux cries alone in a corner
<musictau>: Did you start dating again?
<Steven__>: I know man, I know
<UnstableFlux>: Starting implies I stopped musictau
<UnstableFlux>: I had never started to begin with X-P 
<UnstableFlux>: but yeah since last fall I've been trying to hook-up/flirt/go on dates
<UnstableFlux>: With horrible results
<UnstableFlux>: as usual
<Steven__>: its a wild ride
<TheRealMcFoy2>: Been back at work for two days, and literally had to move two files to different folders, and that’s basicly all I have to do until Monday
<TheCat5001>: i once again learned that all of physics is either thermodynamics or details
<naomi>: im feeling like dropping out at this point
<naomi>: half joking half serious
<TheCat5001>: why so naomi?
<naomi>: the stress
<Steven__>: what year are you in
<naomi>: junior
<Steven__>: damn
<naomi>: my passion for my field is whats keeping me in
<Steven__>: thats a lot of work
<Steven__>: well thats a better motivator than almost anything
<naomi>: this is gonna be a strange analogy but what myself and many of my peers are feeling in our program is like we are a fish out of its tank, and every time we get close to the tank and almost get back in it, they move it to another place
<StopTheWed>: TheRealMcFoy2: gotta love government!
<StopTheWed>: naomi: as cliche as it sounds, and coming from someone who has a career outside of their major, you shouldn't make your job your passion
<naomi>: happened the other way around
<StopTheWed>: welp i messed it up
<naomi>: I love what I do, hate the how my program of study is set up/functioning
<GingerGirl>: I love my job. Hate how it's organized. Yay being an adult

<GingerGirl>: The world doesn't cater to our wants or needs
<naomi>: 2.5 weeks to go, tho. Then summer
<Steven__>: so close yet so far
<naomi>: yeah lol
<GingerGirl_>: I want tacos
<Steven__>: get em
<naomi>: ya
<naomi>: i had qdoba for the first time yesterday. not bad

<naomi>: TheRealMcFoy2: i sure hope so

<DadminFox>: Its basically a 3d factorio
<Wishes>: Thats sick
<DadminFox>: I broke my Factorio addiction for a Satisfactory addiction

<Wishes>: Ultrawides are SO expensive, I'd want one but I can't justify dumping 800 bucks on one
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: Im having a hard time justifying it too, but i really really want one. one day
<musictau>: I have consumed ~1500 calories since I got home
<musictau>: I got a U2718Q
<musictau>: It’s great
<musictau>: When I use it XD
<Wishes>: is that an ultrawide? ;o
<musictau>: No
<musictau>: 27”
<musictau>: 4K 60
<musictau>: Tiny bezels :)
<Wishes>: Oh yeah, I've got that one at work I think
<Wishes>: does it have a matte screen?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: glossy screens are still a thing?
<Wishes>: my LG one is glossy...
<Wishes>: (at home)
<Wishes>: bought it for 400 CAD so it's not a very high end one
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ah

<DadminFox>: you do it at least one day in Basic Training
<StopTheThur>: oh damn
<DadminFox>: Theres nothing better than beating the everliving shit out of your friends
<StopTheThur>: yea was gonna say looks both very satisfying and painful
<DadminFox>: getting smacked in the face with anything sucks, but they're softer than you'd expect
<StopTheThur>: ahh
<DadminFox>: they're called pugil sticks
<StopTheThur>: oh it's part of actual training
<StopTheThur>: TIL
<DadminFox>: mmhmm
<DadminFox>: I think it was week 3 or 4 of basic
<DadminFox>: I miss some Army things
<DadminFox>: but most of it was sitting around doing jack shit, so we had to rake lines in the dirt
<StopTheThur>: yea seeing those videos of guys at posts doing literally nothing...
<StopTheThur>: in the middle of nowhere
<DadminFox>: Thats why I was glad I was combat arms, sure we sat around a bunch, but we interacted with the locals. The kids were hilarious.  Some days were silent, other days were a few firefights

<TheCat5001>: ToastTits: so you're the mysterious woman that bonding is about

<ToastTits>: OH
<ToastTits>: HAHAHAHAHA
<ToastTits>: I actually just wanted some advice, which is why I logged in back here
<ToastTits>: not for me though, it's for a married friend
<ToastTits>: like
<StopTheThur>: WTH
<ToastTits>: she's cheating on her husband!!!!!
<StopTheThur>: a shit Cav ain't here
<StopTheThur>: EXACTLY
<StopTheThur>: OUR EXPERT IS OUT
<StopTheThur>: wait why is she?
<ToastTits>: and like, at first she was venting to me about it and was like "you're the only one who knows don't tell anyone"
<StopTheThur>: deadbedroom?
<ToastTits>: StopTheThur 5 years
<StopTheThur>: 5 years of cheating? or 5 years of a dead beadroom?
<ToastTits>: 2* years of DB
<ToastTits>: no the cheating is pretty recent
<StopTheThur>: oh I can see that.
<StopTheThur>: but usually dead bedroom is a symptom of a larger problem
<StopTheThur>: I actually have a coworker who thinks about marrying this guy, but only has had sex maybe 2? in the last 1.5 years
<ToastTits>: and I'm like, I was pretty sympathetic at first. I mean, I told her it was still wrong but yeah I guess it was... understandable
<StopTheThur>: they have kids?
<StopTheThur>: why don't they just divorce....
<ToastTits>: cause like backstory they're supposed to move to france, so she went there with her husband to look for some places. Then I think the husband had to go to a different city so she had like a week alone in Paris
<ToastTits>: so she met someone and yeah they spent the week together
<ToastTits>: and like, now they're in this weird LDR thing
<StopTheThur>: how old is your friend?
<ToastTits>: 37
<ToastTits>: no kids
<StopTheThur>: interesting
<ToastTits>: and now her husband is paying for her next trip to France for like a month
<ToastTits>: and all she's telling me is how excited she is to see the guy she's cheating with and I'm like
<ToastTits>: dude that's FUCKED up
<StopTheThur>: yea no. that's pretty fucked up
<StopTheThur>: she needs to divorce.
<StopTheThur>: this how she ends up being killed by her husband /s
<ToastTits>: yours husband is paying for your trip and you're going to use it to have a holiday with your side piece?!
<StopTheThur>: yea....
<StopTheThur>: shitty people are shitty
<ToastTits>: like, I don't like listening to her talk about it anymore
<ToastTits>: but I don't want to turn her away cause she's my friend and honestly, this is some pretty juicy gossip
<ToastTits>: HAHAHAHHAHAA
<StopTheThur>: LOL
<StopTheThur>: IRL drama
<ToastTits>: it's so messy, I can't turn my eyes away from this trainwreck
<ToastTits>: Well, her husband is canadian and they got married here, so HE can divorce her but she can't divorce him
<StopTheThur>: it's going to crash
<StopTheThur>: wishes: how does divorce work over in maple land?
<StopTheThur>: WAIT ToastTits. she's not a MAIL ORDER IS SHE?!
<ToastTits>: She's not, she's a freaking doctor
<ToastTits>: hahahahaha
<StopTheThur>: she has money, a husband, and still cheats.... using his paid vacation
<ToastTits>: they started a robotics company together
<StopTheThur>: oof
<StopTheThur>: the legal battle...
<StopTheThur>: is going to suck for him
<ToastTits>: which is one of the reasons she doesn't want to leave him
<ToastTits>: they're worse than married, they're INCORPORATED
<TheCat5001>: doing business with someone you're married to is such a bad idea
<StopTheThur>: ^
<StopTheThur>: or a friend for that matter
<TheCat5001>: yup
<StopTheThur>: business partners =/= friends
<TheCat5001>: you should be able to openly hate your colleagues
<ToastTits>: lol
<ToastTits>: and basically, the company was a huge factor in their DB
<TheCat5001>: seriously, working with someone you despise personally but respect professionaly is so fucking efficient
<StopTheThur>: man ToastTits, MGTOWs would be screaming right now at this situtation
<ToastTits>: since they're business partners and the company isn't doing so good
<StopTheThur>: TheCat5001: +1. yea it works out so well
<ToastTits>: and when she starts to talk about their DB, he's like "I'm tired all the time cause of work"
<ToastTits>: and has explicitly said he wants 12 hours of no disturbance everyday
<TheCat5001>: i love that feeling when you mutually accept that you truly can't stand each other and have moved past it for the sake of professionality
<StopTheThur>: She's a fucking doctor and a startup executive
<StopTheThur>: what does she expect
<ToastTits>: StopTheThur noo, her husband is the one that gets mad
<ToastTits>: he doesn't want to be disturbed for 12 hours hahahaha
<StopTheThur>: yea cause he's working
<StopTheThur>: vagene ain't worth profits
<TheCat5001>: my girlfriend would complain that i would always refuse sex with "i'm tired", until she finally understood that she should stop trying to wake me up in the middle of the night
<ToastTits>: and like, he flips out when she asks what he wants for dinner or lunch or shit
<ToastTits>: cause that counts as distubing him
<StopTheThur>: LOL
<TheCat5001>: bang in the evening or in the morning, or even over lunch, i don't care, but don't disturb my sleep
<StopTheThur>: they seem to have more issues than it seems
<ToastTits>: yup
<StopTheThur>: she's filipino?
<TheCat5001>: he seems to be going straight for a burnout
<ToastTits>: yup
<TheCat5001>: because that seems pretty typical behavior of someone who's depressed/burning out
<StopTheThur>: yea LLC, cheating wife, rage from stessful startup
<StopTheThur>: this guy might off the deep end
<ToastTits>: and I keep telling her maybe he needs therapy or you guys need therapy
<StopTheThur>: she needs therapy too
<ToastTits>: ohhh but nooooooooo she just wants to fuck
<TheCat5001>: he needs a fucking vacation
<StopTheThur>: ^
<ToastTits>: UGH HOW CAN ONE BE SO FUCKING SELFISH
<StopTheThur>: although ToastTits, some guys do get addicted to work
<StopTheThur>: so i can see that
<StopTheThur>: some guys just work non-stop all the time
<StopTheThur>: just because they like it and/or the money/power/influence
<StopTheThur>: etc
<TheCat5001>: StopTheThur: she should give him some shares in the company for every orgasm he gives her
<StopTheThur>: I actually have a friend who works 7 days a week 10-12 hour days
<StopTheThur>: seriously
<TheCat5001>: StopTheThur: my girlfriend recently had a period when she would work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week
<TheCat5001>: she finally said "this isn't worth it anymore" and dropped part of her workload
<ToastTits>: yea idk I kinda wanna give her a piece of my mind but Idk if it's my place
<StopTheThur>: how close are you to her?
<StopTheThur>: if you been friends for years I'd give her some lip
<ToastTits>: like, I just say "hey soooo I thought you were going to patch up things with your husband"
<ToastTits>: StopTheThur been friends for a year
<TheCat5001>: i'm guessing they're within at most 50 km of each other
<ToastTits>: like, "you're the only person I can talk to about my affair" close
<TheCat5001>: okay, 10 km then
<ToastTits>: lol
<StopTheThur>: idk up to you
<TheCat5001>: i still don't really see why people consider sleeping with someone else so abhorrent
<StopTheThur>: i'd stay out of it
<StopTheThur>: since it's pretty fucking deep horsehit now
<ToastTits>: TheCat5001 it's bad if you agreed to be monogamous
<StopTheThur>: not like "i stepped in some". more like a fucking mote of horse diarrhea
<ToastTits>: like, if they were open or some shit
<ToastTits>: I wouldn't care
<ToastTits>: lol
<StopTheThur>: same.
<StopTheThur>: but if you agreed...that's just straight up lying
<ToastTits>: yuuuup
<StopTheThur>: i'd still save some popcorn ToastTits, since you know. shit WILL implode
<StopTheThur>: sooner or later
<ToastTits>: is it bad that I'm looking forward to that
<StopTheThur>: i personally don't think so
<StopTheThur>: since, your friend brought it upon herself
<StopTheThur>: by marrying him AND then starting a company with him
<ToastTits>: I honestly can't wait for it to all blow up on her face
<TheCat5001>: (something completely different ToastTits: i solved a long-standing fundamental problem in theoretical material science \o/)
<gonzobot>: HOOYAH!
<ToastTits>: TheCat5001 WOOOOOHHH CONGRATS!!!

<naomi>: ?
<Hexorg>: (she took a few years of russian in college)
<naomi>: Wym by “same as”
<Hexorg>: but we'd try practicing but speaking in english is a lot faster so we'd revert back to just speaking english

<naomi>: I 100% agree w shexorg
<Hexorg>: yeah
<Hexorg>: if anything I'll try

<GingerGirl_>: This looks horrible
<DadminFox>: The way they wrote the article seems... unprofessional 
<DadminFox>: A highway crash killed "multiple" people and started a large fire on Interstate 70 along the western edge of Denver Thursday, in a disaster that police say was triggered by a semi that slammed into a group of cars that were stopped in traffic.
<DadminFox>: When they quoted "multiple" it just takes away from the actual article. sounds sarcastic

<heili>: Happy friady 
<heili>: Friday even
<MiatasAreForGirls>: heyili 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Nope I regret saying that
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Hey heili
<heili>: LOL
<heili>: how you doing dude?
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Pretty good
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Just got cats 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Living the dream
<MiatasAreForGirls>: How've you been?
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: you married yet miatas?
<heili>: I'm in the midst of training for a half Ironman so basically tired and in pain on a daily basis
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Nice!
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Lmao not quite
<MiatasAreForGirls>: We're going to wait til 2021 I think
<GingerGirl_>: Hey heili 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ah
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: smart man.
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Her siblings got married in 17, 18, and one this year 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Everyone wants a year off lol
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol wow, yeah I can see why youd want to wait
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: hey if your paw in law wants a Shelby as a beater car, I got one to sell him.
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: wifey is craacking down on the projects
<MiatasAreForGirls>: He loves his 2003 Cobra Mustang 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: oh Termi, nice
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: mines a 2007
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Nice
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: but wifey wants a 4Runner, so we need garage room
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Lol he bought a bigger garage when he needed more room 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: if only lol
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ive got another few years before I build another house
<MiatasAreForGirls>: He cycles through cars so fast 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: heili, you ever tried cryotherapy before?
<heili>: no never have
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i would too if I hadd his pocketchange miatas
<MiatasAreForGirls>: And he makes money almost every time 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: It's fucking madness 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: heili, i was curious and tried it today, i'll let you know if its worth it. supposed to help with recovery better than an ice bath
<MiatasAreForGirls>: He bought a 944 for like $12k a year ago and now he's gotten an offer of $15k on it
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: oh very nice
<heili>: Never did ice bath either
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: yeah 944s are becoming popular again
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Yeah that's what he said. He sensed it and bought one 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: dont, ice baths are miserable
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Idk why you would pay for cryotherapy when you can cry in bed at night for free
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: lol
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: im just feeling out different methods for recovering faster that doesnt cost and arm and a leg, and isnt steroids
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: ice baths rock, but its so miserable
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: So far, massages and ice baths work well, as well as some yoga to keep limbered up
<heili>: i can't even imagine how hypothermic i would be if i got in a bathtub full of ice.
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: 3 minutes is almost unbearable. the cryo thing is nitrogen gas instead of water. gets colder, but not as uncomfortable as ice water. 
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: im still reading up on the science behind it, but it looks promising as a recovery tool after a really hard training day or event
<GingerGirl_>: I've listened to Joe Rogan's podcasts before and he does them multiple times a week
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: some times 2 or 3 times a day
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: oh wait i read that wrong
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: looks like it should be used sparingly, according to a couple of studies, as it actually can hinder muscle development. so definitely a once or twice a month thing for me
<heili>: Rogan has a tendency to ... take a grain of fact and exaggerate it into a mountain of BS
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: thats cool bro. you ever tried DMT?
<UnstableFlux>: chyea brudda
<UnstableFlux>: did you know joe rogan has too
<UnstableFlux>: xP
<MiatasAreForGirls>: My friend loves Rogan 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: I only barely see the appeal 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: At least for a 30 year old
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: i enjoy his more controversial guests
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: it can get hilarious
<Do_it_in_a_Datsun>: but his regular sports guests and what not, nah
<MiatasAreForGirls>: I see that 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: But he's claiming that he's one of the funniest people alive 
<MiatasAreForGirls>: Made us watch his standup and no one laughed lmao
