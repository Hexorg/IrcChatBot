<Hexorg>: one more disconnect
<blackbird9999>: hey stopthetues
<StopTheTues>: o/ Rorick
<StopTheTues>: Hexorg: welcome back commander
<blackbird9999>: my internet keeps going out for 30 seconds at a time and it's infuriating.
<blackbird9999>: needed to vent that ha
<StopTheTues>: fuck ISPs
<blackbird9999>: I'm just worried it's a virus. I downloaded a budget software and my antivirus quarantined something when I opened it
<blackbird9999>: Then that's about the time the connection issue started
<blackbird9999>: malwarebytes picked up nothing running so idunno
<blackbird9999>: still paranoid this will be my life now
<StopTheTues>: you're good if malwarebytes didn't find anything
<blackbird9999>: Thank you for your reassuring words stopthetues
<blackbird9999>: I was thinking to myself...if I have a virus doing this...and antivirus can't find it. I wont be able to fix it unless I reinstall my OS FUCK!
<StopTheTues>: if you clean with malwarebytes and a registry cleaner you should be fine, unless you went to some crazy website which is unlikely
<blackbird9999>: I need to start opening up programs I download in Sandboxie
<UnstableFlux>: just reformat
<UnstableFlux>: easy peazy done
<blackbird9999>: Sure that by itself is easy, getting my computer back to whre it was before is a huge pain
<UnstableFlux>: It's 2019
<UnstableFlux>: Do you not just have cloud and/or hard back-ups of everything?
<UnstableFlux>: Or just a simple system restore point? :P
<blackbird9999>: I have my plain files backed up on a separate hard drive locally. But I'd have to reconfigure all my settings reinstal my programs etc right?
<UnstableFlux>: Depends on how you set back-ups
<UnstableFlux>: system restore is better for something like this
<UnstableFlux>: which is why you should set it to make on daily :P
<blackbird9999>: lol not very well. I have created a simple batch file and the xcopy command that I scheduled with task scheduler
<UnstableFlux>: But for me on my SSDs it takes about 45 minutes to reformat, download all my programs from my back-up, and make sure the settings are right
<blackbird9999>: I've never actually used system restore
<UnstableFlux>: So not too much time
<blackbird9999>: it saves the programs you have installed and everything?
<UnstableFlux>: I'm also paranoid and reformat 2-3 times a year so it's 2nd nature to me xD
<UnstableFlux>: Yup!
<UnstableFlux>: It's a system restore point
<UnstableFlux>: All you're doing is telling windows to delete everything that happened/downloaded/etc from after the restore point
<UnstableFlux>: If you choose to restore
<blackbird9999>: ok i'll start a new restore point schedule for daily
<UnstableFlux>: Not as good at getting rid of viruses and malware compared to a reformat but is still good
